Despite taking a 14-month break from the tennis circuit to have a baby, Serena Williams remains the highest-paid female athlete in the world for a third consecutive year Significantly boosted by an endorsement portfolio that’s unrivalled by any other women in sports, Williams raked in a total of $18,1 million (R258 million) in earnings between June last year and June this year, according to Forbes‘ latest list of the highest-paid athletes for 2018. Since returning to the tennis court after giving birth to her first child, Alexis, Williams has collected just $62 000 (R889 000) in winning earnings, with the rest of her earnings generated from her multiple endorsement and sponsorship deals with blue-chip companies like Nike, Beats, Intel and JPMorgan Chase, to name a few. According to Forbes, only 16 athletes – all men – earned more from endorsement deals, with Williams earning more than twice as much as any other female athlete. “She has a lethal combination as the best to play the sport and the story she has with Venus, breaking through as African-American tennis players. Now, as a mother, it adds another layer of attractiveness from a marketers’ standpoint,” Matt Fleming, Director of Celebrity Acquisition at Marketing Arm, was quoted saying in the Forbes report.

This is the third year in a row that Williams has held the spot for the highest-earning athlete, a title that was previously held by her arch-nemesis Maria Sharapova for 11 years straight. Throughout her career, Williams has earned an impressive nest egg of $86 million (R1,2 billion) from prize money earnings, which is twice as much as that earned by Venus, who happens to have collected the second-highest prize money earnings of all time. Caroline Wozniacki is the second highest-earning woman in sports, reaching $13 million (R186 million) over the past year, followed by American rising star Sloane Stephens, who generated a total earnings of $11,2 million (R160 million) over the past year. Stephens earned $5,7 million (R81 million) from prize winnings after winning her first Grand Slam title, the US Open, in 2017 and remains the only other black woman – besides the Williams sisters – to win a Grand Slam title since 2002. Her success on the court led to the signing of a number of lucrative endorsement deals for Nike, Mercedes-Benz, Rolex and Colgate among others, which pushed her endorsement earnings to $5,5 million (R78 million). Venus Williams features at sixth on the list with total earnings of $10,2 million. She’s become quite the hit on the speaking circuit and is able to command as much as $100 000 for an appearance.
