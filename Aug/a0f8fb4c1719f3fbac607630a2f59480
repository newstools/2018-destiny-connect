Equal Education says public schools situated on private land may be under threat because of land expropriation In a statement issued on Thursday, the organisation said the South African Schools Act makes provision for schools to be operated on private land through a long-term lease, but that this right is being threatened by farm-owners controlling the land. “For [pupils] attending public schools situated on private land, particularly farm schools, this right is threatened when farm-owners decide to increase the rent, sell or repurpose their land, or actively try to prevent [pupils] and teachers from accessing the school.” As an example, Equal Education cited Grootkraal Primary School, which has been operated on private land for more than 80 years.

It is further unconscionable that [pupils] should continue going to school with the fear that their access may be impeded or denied.” — News24 Wire
