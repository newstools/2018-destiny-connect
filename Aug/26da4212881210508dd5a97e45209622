President Cyril Rampahosa is playing in the big leagues in as far as his presidential salary is concerned Despite pulling out from most of his investments in order to become Deputy President in 2014, Ramaphosa remains one of the richest black men in the country. With an annual salary of R3,6 million, he is one of the highest-paid government leaders in the world – among the top five to be exact. As a gesture of good faith, Ramaphosa has committed to donating half of his salary for the year to the Madiba Thuma Mina Fund, which will be launched in honour of the late former President Nelson Mandela in his centenary year. While the relative size of Ramaphosa’s salary might shock a few, what will really get your jaw dropping is how much Singapore’s Prime Minister Lee Hsien earns – the equivalent of a staggering $2,2 million (R27 million). This mega-payday, commensurate with the salaries that blue chip CEOs earn, comes despite a three-year salary freeze.

In reality, he will only take home $1 this year, following his decision to donate his presidential salary to different government departments each quarter. Ramaphosa comes in at fourth highest-paid President, followed by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who takes home $267 415 (R3,5 million).

French President Emmanuel Macron is the seventh highest-paid leader with a salary of $211 530 (R2,8 million, followed by Shinzo Abe, the Prime Minister of Japan, who earns $202 700 (R2,7 million).
