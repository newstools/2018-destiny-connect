The #TotalShutDown marches have spilled over to neighbouring Lesotho and Namibia, where women and non-gender-conforming people are taking a stand against gender-based violence Protesters in Lesotho have gathered at Setsoto Stadium and will march to the historical Sefika Sa Moshoeshoe in Maseru. In Namibia, the marchers will gather at Katutura Hospital in Windhoek. Men are excluded from the marches, with organisers advising them to lend their support by staying away from work. Women in South Africa, donning red and black, started gathering across the nine provinces on Wednesday morning, ready to take part in the countrywide protest. In Gauteng, marchers gathered at the old Putco bus depot in Pretoria at 9am. They will then move down Struben Street, turning into Mandela Drive, then Madiba Street, before reaching the front lawns of the Union Buildings, where they will hand over a memorandum.
