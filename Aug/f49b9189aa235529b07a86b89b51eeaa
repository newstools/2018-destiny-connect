A Zimbabwean nurse has been suspended by health authorities for allegedly posting information critical of the ruling Zanu-PF on social media Senzeni Klaasen, employed as a nurse at Beitbridge District Hospital, is said to have accused the party of authoring the country’s agonising economic and political crisis. Beitbridge District Medical Officer Lenos Samhere wrote to Klaasen on 3 August informing her of the charge of misconduct. Samhere alleged that Klaasen, a sister-in-charge at Beitbridge District Hospital, was recorded in an audio clip circulated on social media uttering what hospital authorities considered to be “abusive” words. In the purported audio clip, Klaasen allegedly accused Zanu-PF of causing the mass exodus of Zimbabweans who were going to neighbouring countries in search of greener pastures and seeking medical treatment in countries such as South Africa. In the suspension letter, Samhere said he was implementing the provisions of the Health Service Regulations of 2006, which provides that a disciplinary authority may suspend from service a member who would have committed an act of misconduct or is subject to a criminal investigation or prosecution and whose continued attendance at work would seriously impair the proper administration or functioning of the Ministry of Health and Childcare.
