Black First Land First (BLF) is siding with EFF leader Julius Malema in the now infamous incident that saw Malema allegedly shoot live ammunition during the EFF's fifth birthday celebrations With AfriForum laying criminal charges against Malema over the rifle incident at his party’s birthday bash in East London, BLF now says it will open a case against “the white gunman” seen in a viral video clip being handed back the weapon. ”The irresponsible behaviour of the white gunman was calculated to cause harm to black people. The crowd, which was potentially under threat, was black. The intention of the white man was very clear – that harm should come to black people,” BLF said in a statement.

Malema has reportedly downplayed the firing of a rifle in the video clip taken at the after-party celebrations in Mdantsane’s Sisa Dukashe Stadium on Saturday. The EFF had celebrated its fifth anniversary earlier, with thousands of supporters filling the stadium to the rafters. In the video showing EFF leaders in a song and dance on stage, Malema purportedly fires the rifle into the air, before handing it over to a man in the background and then high-fives EFF Chairman Dali Mpofu.

The Red Berets responded on Wednesday that the firing of the rifle was a simulation to coincide with their celebrations and that no real bullets were fired – only blanks. BLF said it also wanted the gun-owner’s firearm licence to be revoked. – African News Agency
