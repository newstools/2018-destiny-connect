President Cyril Ramaphosa will deliver the annual Desmond Tutu lecture, reflecting on the TRC, as it reaches its 20th anniversary, the Tutus’ foundation announced on Sunday “Archbishop Emeritus Tutu asked the President to reflect in his lecture on the course of South Africa’s restorative justice project 20 years after the Truth and Reconciliation Commission,” the Desmond & Leah Tutu Legacy Foundation said in a statement. “South Africa’s negotiated settlement and approach to post-apartheid justice were internationally regarded as a beacon of hope,” said Programme Manager Razaan Bailey. “To have a leader of the negotiations process, who is now our President, reflect on the nation’s journey to date is a rare opportunity to collectively consider our progress, our successes and shortcomings, and the lessons we have learnt along the way.” The eighth annual Desmond Tutu International Peace Lecture will take place at Artscape in Cape Town on 8 October – the day after Archbishop Tutu’s 87th birthday.
