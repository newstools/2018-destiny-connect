Letty Ngobeni’s dogged determination and never-say-die attitude propelled her property maintenance company to unimaginable heights Poverty may have forced Ngobeni to gain entrepreneurial skills as a child, but she now thrives on knowing that her difficult background in Nkuri village in the Limpopo province laid the perfect foundation for her successful career. “I’ve been a business person since the age of 12. While I was in high school, I was selling chicken feet,” she recalls. Her mother was employed as a domestic worker during the week and Ngobeni would take over the job for the same family on weekends. She used the R10 she earned from it every month to buy the chicken feet. After matriculating at the age of 15, and lacking the money to further her education, she approached her primary school principal to give her a job as an unqualified teacher. In addition to bursaries she received, the money she earned funded her studies towards a teaching degree. Once she’d obtained it, she assumed a job as a high school teacher.
