Fans of the hit sitcom The Big Bang Theory will have to bid the cast farewell at the end of season 12 The TV network made the decision to cancel the long-running series that was once regarded as the best shows on TV because the show’s biggest star – Jim Parsons, aka Dr Sheldon Cooper – was reportedly ready to leave the show. It wasn’t the network’s first option, according to an EW report. It had wanted the show to continue for another two years before pulling the plug, but had to push up plans significantly after failing to convince Parsons, who is one of the highest-paid actors, receiving almost $1 million (R14,3 million) per episode, to stay on. With his character tying the knot with long-time girlfriend Amy Farrah Fowler in the season finale of season 11, Parsons said he felt there was no further potential for character development and that it was time to walk away.
