When American songstress Ciara jetted into South Africa last month, we thought it was for a vacation with her husband Russell Wilson, but actually, she was here to shoot a new video for her upcoming album This week, the singer debuted her single Freak Em, not long after she released Level Up, which spawned the #LevelUpChallenge. She enlisted photographer and creative director Trevor Stuurman and designer Rich Mnisi to style her for the video. In the video clips she shared on her Instagram, which have been watched over 2 million times, Ciara is seen wearing a zebra-skin top, black leather shorts by Mnisi, an indzila (Ndebele choker) and shades. Her hair was styled in cornrows with four buns in a pigtails-type hairdo. The back-up dancers are wearing xibelani (Tsonga traditional skirts/regalia) and African print dresses. If you recognise some South African dance moves in the video, it’s courtesy of local choreographer and singer Sino Dunywa, who said she was given just two hours after hearing the song to come up with the moves. Here’s what the South Africans had to say about working with Ciara.
