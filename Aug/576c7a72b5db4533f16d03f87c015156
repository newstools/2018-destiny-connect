When buying your dream car, one of the decisions you may have to make is whether to opt for a balloon payment at the end of your instalment term It turns out that balloons or residual vehicle payment are more than just festive decorations. Balloon payments have become very popular in the last few years because they basically let you buy a more expensive car by bringing down your monthly repayments. The catch is that sneaky not-so-little repayment you get smacked with at the end of your finance term. Essentially, a balloon payment allows you to pay less on your monthly instalment because it is calculated on the loan amount only and doesn’t include that balloon payment. A balloon payment is in effect an inflation of your capital amount at a percentage, normally 30%, built as a final instalment at the end of your finance period. This leaves you with several options when your contract comes to an end: settle the balloon payment once and for all, re-finance the car, and sell it to cover the amount. “The long and short of it is that you end up paying a substantial amount more than what the car is actually worth with a balloon payment,” says Charl Potgieter, Head Absa Vehicle and Asset Finance, Personal Markets at Absa. “However, sometimes that is the only way you can afford to buy a car, which makes it a bit of a catch-22.” READ MORE: The good, bad and the ugly news about balloon payments Where exactly does this leave you?
