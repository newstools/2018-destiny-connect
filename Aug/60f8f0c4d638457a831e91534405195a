Summer days are on their way – welcome them back with this bright new nail trend! As the weather warms up, you can keep your hands looking as cool as jelly with the new manicure trend – jelly nails. Different from regular fake nails, which have a block of colour, jelly nails are translucent. You can choose an option that is clear or coloured with a see-through effect. The nails can be created by a nail salon such as Ma Cherie in Bryanston, Johannesburg, or you can try an at-home manicure with a pre-bought set. At a salon, the manicure will likely take 60- 90 minutes and cost around R400. The price may be higher than some other options, such as regular nail varnish, but could be worth it, because jelly nails can last 3-4 weeks.
