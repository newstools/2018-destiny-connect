South African households were richer in 2017, but it's not all good news as some families will start feeling the pinch Momentum and Unisa collaborated on the Household Net Wealth Index, which reveals the net wealth of households in South Africa. It revealed that the real net wealth increased from R451,6 billion in 2016 to R7 344,3 billion in 2017. This is the first real increase since 2014. “This is good news, as the financial purpose of households is to build their wealth and in so doing, improve their chances of being financially well,” the report states. However, the bad news is that the majority of the top 20% household income group cannot be classified as rich. “Most of these households earn R20 000-R45 000 per month. Given the income taxes they pay, the proportion of their income they use to repay debt (instalments), the high prices of transport, education and medical care, as well as the recent steep increases in food prices, they face a number of financial challenges – hardly the characteristics of a rich household.” READ MORE: Gauteng household debt climbing The drastic increase between the 2016 and 2017 household income value can be attributed to a strong increase of 7,9% in the real value of households’ financial assets. “Financial assets, in turn, received a boost in the second half of 2017 from the strong performances of listed shares and bonds – the instruments in which households’ retirement funds and other savings are invested. As such, the increase in the real value of household financial assets was responsible for 88,0% of the 6,6% increase in the real value of their assets.” The index revealed that households’ contributions to retirement funds are declining from 15% in 2008 to 10,8% in 2017. Retirement funds include wealth creation and protection instruments which now means households have been negatively impacted in their potential to increase the value of their assets and their net wealth. South African households’ disposable income, when expressed as a percentage, stands at 449,8% up from 438% in 2016. This, however, is a low ratio compared to other countries tracked by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The average disposable income for these countries as 588% in 2014.

Momentum/Unisa estimates South Africa’s household debt to disposable income ratio at 71,4% at the end of 2017 – and it is much lower than the average of the OECD-countries of around 140% (in 2016).” The index also showed that households with a completed tertiary education have the lion’s share of household net wealth as well as households with middle-aged individuals. “They have 51,6% of total income, 57,8% of net wealth and 59,2% of assets, while they are also responsible for 66.2% of all outstanding liabilities. In terms of age distribution, some 53,3% of household net wealth is in the hands of households between the ages of 45 and 54 years.”
