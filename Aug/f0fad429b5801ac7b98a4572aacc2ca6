The SABC is currently close to R700m in debt. The public broadcaster owes its creditors R694 million, with further accruals of R475 million expected, SABC CFO Yolande van Biljon told the Portfolio Committee on Communications on Tuesday. Furthermore, by the end of this month, the SABC will have only R26 million in its bank account, after salaries and about 25% of the outstanding debt are paid. “Our financial situation is very dire,” said SABC board Chairperson Bongumusa Makhathini. Newly appointed SABC CEO Madoda Mxakwe said the SABC had “serious liquidity challenges”. He said a financially burdened public broadcaster not only affects its employees, but also the local production industry.

They have been engaging Treasury to ensure they get funding. SABC COO Chris Maroleng said they have a “significant funding gap” to obtain broadcasting rights for sport events, while the SABC, as public broadcaster, has a regulatory mandate to broadcast sporting events deemed to be in the national interest according to the regulations set up by Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa). He said the SABC’s failure to broadcast these events will lead to reputational damage, an outcry from the public and it might lead to a decline in advertising revenue and a decline in TV licence payments as a backlash. Furthermore, if they don’t comply with the regulations, they could be fined up to R500 000. He said the SABC is not protected by 2010 sports broadcasting regulations. The regulations prescribe sporting events which must be broadcast by the SABC in the national interest.

He said the regulations are eight years old. The idea was to make sport more accessible for South Africans. But the sports rights association knows that the SABC has to obtain the rights, therefore they can push up the price. The committee supported the idea of looking into the regulations and committee Chairperson Humphrey Maxegwana said they will engage Icasa about sporting rights. Despite the grim financial picture that was painted, the committee was also satisfied that the SABC is on the right track. They will soon present their turnaround strategy to the committee. DA MP Phumzile van Damme said she is “cautiously optimistic”. “It seems like the SABC has a handle on the issues,” she said. “Please do not disappoint us when you present your turnaround plan.” READ MORE: ANC is demanding more coverage from the SABC Maxegwana said: “You are getting there.
