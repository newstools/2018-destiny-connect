Magnus Malan has been in the headlines for the first time since the news of his death seven years ago – for the wrong reasons Malan, not to be mistaken with DF Malan, was a high-ranking member of Parliament and served as a Minister during PW Botha’s term as Prime Minister during the apartheid era. However, it is the allegations of him being an integral part of a paedophilia ring involving young coloured boys that’s got the country reeling in shock. A recently released book details how he and two other government Ministers (one of whom is still alive) kidnapped young boys, ploughed them with alcohol and then raped them. It is said that in one incident, Malan inserted a pistol into the anal cavity of one of the boys and fired a shot, leaving the boy in critical condition. The book, The Lost Boys Of Bird Island, co-authored by Mark Minnie and Chris Steyn, was released last week and alleged that Malan and company went to shocking lengths to protect themselves from ever being found out – even killing possible informants or those investigating the allegations and making their deaths look like suicides.
