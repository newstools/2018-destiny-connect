The Constitutional Court found on Monday that the appointment of National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) boss Shaun Abrahams was unconstitutional and invalid Justice Mbuyiseli Madlanga said former President Jacob Zuma’s decision to terminate Abraham’s predecessor Mxolisi Nxasana’s position as the National Director of Public Prosecutions (NDPP) was an abuse of power and that the Abrahams was a beneficiary of that abuse. Thus, the appointment of Abrahams was unconstitutional as well. On 8 December 2017, the North Gauteng High Court in Pretoria declared Zuma’s conduct in the matter unconstitutional. Judge Dunstan Mlambo ordered President Cyril Ramaphosa in December 2017 – while he was still Deputy President – to appoint a new head of the NPA after the court declared the post vacant.
