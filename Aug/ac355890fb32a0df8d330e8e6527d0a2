Just like it takes a village to raise a child, Nomzamo Mbatha believes it takes a community to celebrate graduation In April this year, Nomzamo Mbatha graduated with a BCom Accounting degree from the University of Cape Town. It was a notable achievement for the actress who had initially dropped out due to financial reasons. However it was a bittersweet day due to the absence of many loved ones. To find a way of incorporating them, Mbatha had a dress designed with pictures of late family members such as her two sisters, father and grandmother. In recognition of the suicide of her younger sister, she also included the telephone number for the South African Depression & Anxiety Group, and words of encouragement and support. These tributes were a way of making her family part of the day. Mbatha also decided to include a wider community in the graduation joy.  Ahead of the ceremony, she invited fellow UCT graduates to join her #GraduationGlamRoom and get their make up done courtesy of her and Ground Zero Productions. She had a makeup team on standby for students who would be graduating on April 3, the same day as her. Here are images of the striking dress that paid tribute to the community that made her the woman she is today:
