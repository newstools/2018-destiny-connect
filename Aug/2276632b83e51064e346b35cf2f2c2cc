Violent protests broke out in Zimbabwe following elections earlier this week The Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) has invoked provisions of the Public Order and Security Act (Posa), as tensions escalate in the aftermath of the country’s post-coup elections. ZRP national spokesperson Senior Assistant Commissioner Charity Charamba said Wednesday night that Police Commissioner-General Godwin Matanga had invoked provisions of Section 37 (1) of the Posa. Posa was notoriously used by the administration of former President Robert Mugabe to suppress dissent. Charamba warned demonstrators against setting ablaze vehicles, assaulting vendors, taking their wares, damaging shops and conducting unlawful gatherings, saying law enforcement agents would arrest all of them. She said the police had enlisted the services of the Zimbabwe National Army to restore order in the country. Charamba said her boss Matanga had approached home affairs and cultural heritage minister Obert Mpofu to request the assistance of the Defence Forces for the suppression of the violence and disturbances in the capital central business district. “The ZDF will remain under the command of the commissioner of the police,” she said. Meanwhile, police are said to be looking for MDC Alliance leaders Tendai Biti and Happymore Chidziva for allegedly inciting demonstrations which turned violent. -Africa News Agency
