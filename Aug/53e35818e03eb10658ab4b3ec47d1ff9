Gauteng police have arrested the final suspect they sought in the murder of actor and football player Dumisani Masilela Police spokesperson Brigadier Mathapelo Peters said the 34-year-old man, the sixth suspect in the 2017 murder, was nabbed on Sunday. The 29-year-old Rhythm City actor died in August last year, after he was shot at in Tembisa South by the occupants of a black Jeep. At the time of the shooting, police established that six people had committed the murder. “The initial four were arrested last year, while the fifth suspect died in a robbery,” Peters said. After being shot once, Masilela managed to drive himself to hospital, where he underwent surgery. He died later that day as a result of his injuries.
