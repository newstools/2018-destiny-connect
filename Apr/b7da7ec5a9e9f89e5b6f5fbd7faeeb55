Nkonki was thrust into controversy after a media exposè that revealed that Salim Essa, an associate of the Gupta family, who has been accused of corrupt relationships with senior government officials, had funded the R107 million management buyout by Nkonki’s majority shareholder and former CEO Mitesh Patel, who resigned earlier this month. In a statement issued late Monday by Nkonki’s lawyers, Nicqui Galaktiou Inc, the firm said that it “was left with no option but to voluntarily wind up the company”.
