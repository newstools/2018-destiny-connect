Former Cabinet Minister Sydney Mufamadi denied that he approached the special security branch to re-open an investigation into the murder of teenager Stompie Seipei, as claimed in the documentary Winnie Mufamadi shot down a version of events in the documentary told by the then head of the murder and robbery squad, Henk Heslinga. Heslinga claimed Mufamadi, as the Safety and Security Minister at the time, approached him in 1995 to reopen the investigation. Opening an investigation was the responsibility of a Police Commissioner, and not a Minister, said Mufamadi. “As a senior officer, Heslinga knew better… and why would I tell him that I am a member of the ANC NEC? Why was that relevant to him?” asked Mufamadi. He said the police did not have a slush fund, as alleged by Heslinga. The award-winning documentary was first aired publicly in the aftermath of Madikizela-Mandela’s death. It drew an outcry after it showed how a propaganda plan was hatched allegedly by some in Madikizela-Mandela’s beloved ANC, apartheid government leaders and journalists to weaken her politically.

People against whom these chilling allegations are made are alive and available… they have a right to put forward their version.” He said Madikizela-Mandela was not the only ANC leader to appear before the TRC, as several others did, including himself, for kidnapping a police officer during the heydays of apartheid. – African News Agency
