South African food giant Tiger Brands said late on Wednesday it had received confirmation of the presence of the LST6 listeria strain in samples taken from its Enterprise Polokwane processed meat facility. Tiger Brands says independent laboratory tests have confirmed the presence of the deadly ST6 strain of listeria in its products. The company recalled all products from its Enterprise facilities in Polokwane, Pretoria and Germiston in March after  polony produced in its Polokwane plant was linked to a deadly outbreak of listeriosis which had killed 180 people. Initially, the company said tests ordered by the National Consumer Commission for listeria were inconclusive, and that the samples had been sent for re-testing. “The purpose of this announcement is to update shareholders on the results of the independent laboratory re-testing which was carried out in respect of the presence of ST6 in the above samples,” Tiger Brands said on Wednesday.
