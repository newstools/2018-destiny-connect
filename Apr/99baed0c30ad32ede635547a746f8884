Mokoena told State Prosecutor Phakanyiswa Marasela that she has last seen her late sister at their parents’ house. “She left that evening. I went to work and when I got back, my mother asked me if Karabo was home. I replied that the last time I saw her was Thursday evening when she wanted to go out,” Mokoena said. Her mother was uncomfortable that Karabo had left without a word, and asked Bontle to contact some of her friends, one of whom said she had not seen the young woman.
