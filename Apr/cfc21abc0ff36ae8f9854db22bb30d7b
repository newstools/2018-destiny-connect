The tiny African kingdom of Swaziland is changing its name. The kingdom will now be known by its historic name of eSwatini King Mswati III made the announcement on Thursday during celebrations of the country’s 50th anniversary of independence and his 50th birthday celebrations, AP reports. Many African countries upon independence “reverted to their ancient, native names,” he said. “We no longer shall be called Swaziland from today forward.” The name of eSwatini has been used before in the past at openings of Parliament and other events. It is not immediately clear how much it will cost the landlocked African country to make the name change. – African News Agency
