AT least five people were wounded when a woman with a gun went on the rampage at YouTube’s headquarters in San Bruno, California, last night  It was reported that the attacker, said to be a white woman in a dark top and a headscarf, fired at least 20 shots. Staff said they saw blood on the floor of one of the four buildings as they rushed for the exit. San Francisco General Hospital said it had taken a number of victims and at least four were admitted to Stanford Hospital. Employee Vadim Lavrusik tweeted: ‘Active shooter at YouTube HQ. Heard shots and saw people running. Now barricaded inside a room with co-workers.’ His colleague Todd Sherman described scenes of panic as staff fled. “We were in a meeting and then heard people running because it was rumbling the floor,” he said. “First thought was ‘earthquake’. “We headed towards the exit. At that point every new person I saw was a potential shooter.” One woman told CNN: ‘We were suddenly aware of loud sounds and after that, there was just panic.’ – African News Agency, The Telegraph
