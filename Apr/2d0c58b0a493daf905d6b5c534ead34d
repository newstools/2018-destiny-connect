Comedian Ndumiso Lindi and Tumi Morake are going on the road with a new stand-up comedy show that promises to tickle your funny bone Titled Married…But Not to Each Other, the show was inspired by the duo’s travel adventures on a previous tour where they were asked by customs officials whether they were married. Without thinking, Lindi said “yes”, before clarifying: “But not to each other”, and so the show was born. “The show is a hilarious take on the roles and regulations of marriage and the pothole-laced roads the sexes have to navigate. It’s not just about marriage. It is about the world that these marriages have to survive in,” the pair said in a statement.

Having already completed two sold-out shows in Cape Town and one show in Menlyn, Pretoria, last month, the pair will hit the Lyric Theatre at Gold Reef City, Johannesburg on 14 April, before heading to Gaborone, Botswana, Silverstar Casino in Jozi and the Emnotweni Casino in Nelspruit next month. If you plan on taking a minor to the show, bear in mind that it carries a PG16 age restriction. For more information on tour dates and to purchase tickets, visit Computicket.
