"One day they will wish [the case never] continued" These were the words of former President Jacob Zuma spoke in his address to a sea of supporters, dressed in the ANC colours of green, gold and black, outside the KwaZulu-Natal High Court in Durban on Friday morning after his brief appearance. The proceedings got under way at 9.30am, but were over after about 10 minutes. The case was postponed to 8 June. Zuma is facing 16 charges relating to 783 payments he allegedly received in connection with the controversial arms deal. Speaking in isiZulu to a large crowd gathered outside the court, Zuma defended his name and said it had been dragged through the mud. He said the case had been reinstated for political reasons.

Opposition parties turned to the courts because they had failed in Parliament, he told the crowd. “They don’t say: ‘There are allegations against Zuma.’ They only say: ‘Zuma is corrupt.'” Zuma thanked the crowd for supporting him, as they had previously. He claimed he was innocent, even though he was being treated like a criminal. ”Our country’s Constitution states that the accused is innocent until proven guilty. However, there are some people, even people whom I trusted, who have judged me as guilty already. The truth will be revealed in time.” READ MORE: Zuma to appear in court on corruption charges “Your presence here shows that you understand the Constitution and law that well.” Zuma belted out Umshini Wami before he left the court. – News24
