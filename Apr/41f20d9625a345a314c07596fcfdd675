Former Eskom CEO Brian Molefe and his legal team will now have to regroup, after the High Court in Pretoria on Tuesday refused them leave to appeal the January decision which ordered Molefe to pay back all money received from his pension payout Molefe’s lawyer Barry Farber spoke to journalists at the Pretoria court following the ruling on Tuesday, saying: “We are gonna consult, and regroup, and see what happens.” Farber said at this stage it was not a foregone conclusion that Molefe’s next move would be to petition the Supreme Court of Appeal in Bloemfontein to hear his case – appealing the High Court’s January decision. “We need his instructions – I can’t tell a client what to do,” said Farber. The lawyer said Molefe will now abide by the High Court’s decision. However the former Eskom CEO will not pay back an amount he doesn’t feel is fair. “Obviously he is going to abide by the court judgment, but he is not going to pay back that which he does not think he should. That is something else that needs to be deliberated on, and debated. Surely, he is a law-abiding citizen and he will abide by the court ruling, for sure,” said Farber.

The judges said there is no prospect of a different positive judgment for Molefe, even if he takes his appeal to the Supreme Court of Appeal. “Mr Molefe applies for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Appeal against the whole of the judgement and order of this court handed down on 25 January 2018. We have carefully considered arguments advanced by counsel for all the parties,” Judge Elias Matojane said, as he delivered judgment on Tuesday. “We are of the view that there is no prospect that another court would come to a different conclusion on any of the grounds of appeal raised by Mr Molefe. The leave to appeal is refused for reasons set out in the main judgement.” The court also ordered Molefe to pay the costs, “including the cost of two counsel who were so employed”. Molefe left Eskom under a cloud after being implicated in a damning “state capture” report by former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela alleging undue influence by personal friends of then President Jacob Zuma in the running of state firms. READ MORE: Solidarity lays criminal charges against Brian Molefe On 25 January, the High Court ruled that Molefe’s subsequent reinstatement at the power company was “at variance with the principle of legality and is invalid and false”. “We also found that Mr Molefe was never entitled to receive any pension benefits from the Eskom pension fund, and any payments made in lieu of such benefits were patently unlawful,” Judge Matojane read out the judgement on behalf of a full bench of high court judges in January. That January court matter had been brought by South Africa’s official opposition, the DA, and trade union Solidarity – who were seeking an order declaring Molefe’s R30-million pension payout unlawful and for it to be set aside. Meanwhile, Solidarity insisted on Tuesday that Molefe has to pay back the R11 million  immediately, or further action will be instituted. “He has to do it [the payment] immediately. That money is unlawful, it was money meant to enrich him at the detriment of Eskom and the taxpayers. From a criminal point of view, that also boils down to fraud. He must immediately pay back that specific money,” said Solidarity CEO Dirk Hermann. “We have also laid criminal charges against Mr Molefe. The Hawks have indicated that they will investigate. They said they have already started with the investigation.” – African News Agency
