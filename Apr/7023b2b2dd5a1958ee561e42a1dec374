His body was recovered by the Pietermaritzburg search-and-rescue team on Friday at around 10am. Shweni was a father to two girls, the oldest of whom is seven years old. Deputy Chairperson of the South African Guild of Actors Adrian Galley described Shweni as a “bright and educated chap”. He said he was an IT specialist and businessman. “I believe he had a lot to offer. He was a very generous, [considerate] man and quite an activist in relation to helping society. “Having two daughters, he wanted to create a better world for them. One of the daughters told his cousin, Andrea (Dondolo), that she was still waiting for him to do her hair.

Dondolo is a well-known South African actress. She was unable to speak to News24. ‘This is not the Wild West’ Galley said the tragedy had raised questions around safety in the industry, specifically the need for actors to work in environments with strict safety precautions. “Filming locations – every day you get different environmental hazards to contend with, so safety should be even more strictly enforced.” He said there were industry guidelines to ensure safety on set. “There are very strict protocols within the industry. For instance, you will have a highly trained stunt coordinator whose job it is to assess the risk involved in those particular action sequences,” Galley said. However, these established protocols are not always enforced, he said. “This is not the Wild West. We have a responsibility to make sure that we run a clean operation.” On Tuesday, Monks Cowl tourism park said the incident had happened just outside its grounds. There was no further comment. – News24
