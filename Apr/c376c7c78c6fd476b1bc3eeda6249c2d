Sandile Mantsoe – who allegedly killed and burnt the body of his girlfriend of eight months, Karabo Mokoena - is expected to appear in the High Court in Johannesburg on Friday On Thursday, a police captain told the court about the toxic relationship Mantsoe had with Mokoena and that he had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Captain Rogers Mahundla read a statement that he wrote with assistance from Mantsoe, which said that Mokoena was violent and addicted to the “high life”. In the statement, Mantsoe alleged that Mokoena had multiple sexual partners, including a Nigerian man who gave her R100 000 a month. Mantsoe said that Mokoena was angry and depressed after being raped, allegedly by one of her Nigerian boyfriend’s friends, and had crashed his grey Mercedes-Benz. Mantsoe said he told Mokoena that he no longer wanted to be with her hours before she allegedly committed suicide.

I went to the toilet and wrapped her and left the room. I pulled her body to the toilet and left,” Mantsoe’s statement read. “I went to get a tyre in Lyndhurst and a place to dispose of the body. I went back to my apartment and tried to figure out how to get her out and got a bin. I managed to put her in the bin and drove to Bramley. I put the tyre and fuel on her and I burnt her. I didn’t kidnap her, she came to me on her own. I didn’t kill her, I panicked because of the suicide and overdose.” Mokoena was reported missing on 28 April last year, and her photographs circulated on social media. Her body was found the next day in a shallow grave. – African News Agency
