The Reserve Bank's recent decision to cut interest rates by 25 basis points – a small drop – isn't as insignificant as you may think when it comes to your bond In the wake of the first Vat increase to hit SA since the dawn of the democracy, consumers are desperate for a little relief wherever they can find it. Those home-owners servicing an unfixed interest rate home loan may be tempted to cash in on the immediate saving resulting from the lower interest rate, but bond originator BetterBond CEO Rudi Botha says there’s a smarter way to optimise your savings. Using an example of a 20-year bond on a property valued at R912 000, Botha says a home-owner would save around R151 per month – a nominal saving.

The interest rate cut has also brought marginal relief for first-time home-buyers who will now find it easier to qualify for a home loan. Based on the example above, the gross monthly household income required to qualify for a home loan drops from R30 000  to R29 000. BetterBond’s latest statistics indicate that the average bond being granted to first-time homebuyers is R715 000 and with the interest rate reduction, your monthly bond repayment amount would fall from R7 018 to R6 899, while the the monthly income required to qualify for a home loan would decrease from R24 000 to R23 000. “This relief, coming in the wake of a significant drop in the inflation rate to 4% last month and the Moody’s decision to keep SA’s investment rating out of the “junk” zone, is bound to buoy consumer confidence, and will mitigate the effects of the Vat increase and the fuel tax increases,” he says. With the South African economy expected to grow at a faster rate than initially anticipated, Botha says it’s likely that banks will have a greater appetite for approving more home loan applications over the next 18 months.

This is confirmed by a drop in the percentage of bonds granted in the R250 000 to R500 000 category, from 18,8% to 15,4%, and a corresponding increase in the percentage of bonds granted in the R500 000 to R1 million category, from 38,5% to 41,2%,” says Botha.
