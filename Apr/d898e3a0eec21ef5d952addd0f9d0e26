Five employees of a cash delivery company have been arrested in connection with a cash-in-transit heist earlier this month The men, aged 30-48, were arrested for their role in a heist on 13 April, during which R30 million was stolen. Spokesperson for the Hawks in Gauteng, Captain Ndivhuwo Mulamu, said the arrests were the result of an investigation by the Hawks’ National Bureau of Illegal Firearms Control and Priority Violent Crime. On 13 April, the gang targeted an armoured cash vehicle which had left a depot in Spartan, east of Johannesburg, en route to Selby. But before it got to its destination, the vehicle stopped in Kensington. The armoured vehicle was opened from the back and three men took money bags from it and fled with about R30 million in cash.

They were subsequently found unconscious and taken to a nearby hospital for treatment where it was established that they apparently drank soft drinks spiked with an unknown substance,” Mulamu said. She said the five people who were arrested were Nkosinathi Feni (48), Gabriel Mbhango (35), Siphiwe Hlungwane (45), Bavuyise Ndaba (30), and Petros Ndlovu (38). Their case had been postponed until next Monday for further investigation. Police are still looking for four other suspects, one of whom was the driver of the armoured vehicle.
