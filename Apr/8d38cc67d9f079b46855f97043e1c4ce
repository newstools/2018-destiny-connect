The South African National Editors’ Forum (Sanef) says it was "deeply concerned and disgusted" by the labelling of prominent South African journalists and editors as "StratCom" agents in front-page articles published by Independent Media-owned newspapers “This is a sad day for South African journalism. The Independent Media group has been a critical part of the media landscape for decades. Some of the finest journalism to come out of this country has been produced by journalists working on titles like The Star, Cape Times and The Mercury,” Sanef said in a statement on Friday. Sanef said it believed the attack on journalists playing their watchdog role in investigating private sector irregularities “is not only defamatory, but disgusting”. On Friday, all Independent Media group newspapers carried front page stories titled Exposed: StratCom Version 2018. The article alleges that the company has evidence that senior executives of a major competitor had plotted to scupper the listing of Sagarmatha Technologies on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. The “evidence” allegedly points to a dirty tricks campaign, similar to those employed by StratCom during apartheid to demonise the late struggle veteran Winnie Madikizela-Mandela.

The report comes shortly after allegations were made that a number of journalists had been employed by the apartheid government as spies. According to an eNCA report, in a video clip, which was recently published on HuffPost SA, Madikizela-Mandela said 40 journalists were helping StratCom with its smear campaign against her. Two of the names mentioned were Professor Anton Harber and the SABC’s Thandeka Gqubule. Sanef said this was the second time, in as many weeks, that prominent journalists had been called “StratCom” agents, without any proof being provided by those making the accusations. ‘Defamatory piece’ The issue at hand this time was the unsuccessful listing of Sagarmatha Technologies on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange by the owners of Independent Media.

“The PIC invests money on behalf of government employees in projects to grow and strengthen democracy. We believe that labelling bona fide journalists ‘StratCom’ agents for investigating a private sector transaction fundamentally undermines this purpose.” Sanef said it stood in solidarity with editors and journalists within the Independent Group who valued editorial independence, but were seemingly powerless to stop these stories. – News24
