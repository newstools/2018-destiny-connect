Try these cute kiddie hairstyles to protect your daughter's hair during the colder months Winter is not the time to let your daughter wear her hair loose – make sure the hair is in a protective style to prevent breakage caused by the harsh winter weather. Mummy Mthembu-Fawkes, founder of the Earthy haircare product line, says the best hairstyle for little girls is benny-and-betty, as it’s less strenous on the hair and scalp. “The number one hairstyle for young girls is benny-and-betty. Make it as loose as possible,” she says. Mthembu-Fawkes adds that the aim of a protective style is to protect the ends and not the roots, hence pulling isn’t advisable. “The aim is to keep the hair flexible and protect it from the harsh winter weather. When the hair is in a protective style, it prevents it from the breakage, shredding and manipulation it would otherwise encounter if it had been worn loose,” she says.
