American rapper Kendrick Lamar has won a Pulitzer for his raw and powerful Grammy-winning album Damn The 30-year-old rapper is the first non-classical or jazz artist to win the prestigious prize. Since he emerged in the music scene with his album Section 80, the star has achieved the perfect mix of commercial appeal and critical respect. The Pulitzer Prize website called the album, which was released in 2017, “a virtuosic song collection unified by its vernacular authenticity and rhythmic dynamism that offers affecting vignettes capturing the complexity of modern African-American life”. The star has often been praised for his deep lyrical content, politically charged live performance and his profound mix of hip-hop, spoken word, poetry and African sounds.

His platinum-selling major-label albums – good kid, m.A.A.d city, To Pimp a Butterfly and DAMN – became works of art, with Lamar writing songs about blackness, street life, police brutality, perseverance, survival and self-worth. This makes his win more important.

His musical success helped him win 12 Grammy Awards. Additional reporting by Sydney Morning Herald
