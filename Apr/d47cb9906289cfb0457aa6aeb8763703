EFF leader Julius Malema has responded to lobby group AfriForum’s decision to privately prosecute him Shortly after the announcement, Malema tweeted a picture of himself and party General-Secretary Godrich Gardee dancing on stage and captioned it: “Bring it on, bloody racists, you don’t scare me at all. I’m born ready! No white man will decide my destiny, the poor masses of our people will.” The lobby group announced on Thursday morning at a press conference in Centurion that it intended to privately prosecute Malema on charges of fraud and corruption.

The group previously threatened legal action against Malema after he allegedly made racist remarks at a political gathering in March. At the time, Malema allegedly said white people should be glad that the EFF did not call for a genocide. The lobby group said the prosecution was related to the On-Point Engineering’s tender case, which was struck off the roll in 2015 by the Polokwane High Court.
