In South Africa, the tourism capital of Cape Town received about 350 000 Airbnb guests from over 150 countries, earning each host about R39 348 over roughly 27 nights. In the commercial hub of Johannesburg, 60 000 arrivals were recorded from 133 countries,  earning each host about R15 969, while homeowners in the coastal city of Durban had 40 000 guests and each earned about R20 000.

Since Airbnb was founded, it has opened up destinations to travellers off the typical tourist path and has brought economic benefits to  small businesses and local residents. “Building off of this work through partnerships, programmes and events, Airbnb will expand its efforts to economically empower communities, drive travel to lesser-known places, and support environmentally-friendly travel habits,” the company said in its latest report. Last year London-based online estate agency Nested’s global Property ROI Index ranked Durban as the top city in the world to recoup the value of your property. It would take a Durban homeowner renting property through Airbnb 18 months to settle their bond compared to the 167 months it would take to pay off the bond if the owner goes through traditional rental channels.

Second on the list is property in Lagos, Nigeria, where homeowners who use Airbnb could pay off their bond in 22 months, followed by Cairo, Egypt, with 23 months and Reykjavik, Iceland, with 33 months. – African News Agency
