Dark lips are all the rage. Watch this video to see how you too can make this look work. Punks and goths have been rocking dark lipstick for years. The look is now popular with celebrities such as Lorde and Rihanna. Even models are wearing darker lips on the runway, with the trend recently seen during Paris Fashion Week at Dior’s show. Keagan Cafun, senior resident make-up artist for MAC Cosmetics South Africa, shows us how to recreate the look, but with a mixture of Victoriana and punk with a softer, more romantic edge. The lipstick used in the video is superstar Ariana Grande’s Viva Glam dark purple shade. Instead of the usual matte look, Keagan elevates the style by using black lip liner and a touch of lip gloss, making the overall style more dramatic. To make this dramatic look work, keep your face clean so your lips do all the talking.
