I was open to it if it came along,” she was quoted saying. “So when [production house] Cheeky Media and the SABC gave me the thumbs-up, I was happy. I didn’t realise how much I missed television as a medium. I wanted the immediate gratification that radio gave me, but I missed looking into the camera and doing my thing.” Mosaka promises to bring her personal flair to the show. Real Talk with Anele airs weekdays on SABC3 from 6pm-7pm.
