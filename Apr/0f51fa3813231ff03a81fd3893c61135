EFF leader Julius Malema on Wednesday called for the respect of all women, both in politics and at home at a Winnie Madikizela-Mandela memorial service He was speaking at a memorial service held at the Majwemasweu Stadium in Deeplevel, Brandfort, directly opposite the house which Winnie Madikizela-Mandela and her children occupied when she was banished by the apartheid police in 1977. “[Women] are capable of doing what men can do. They can operate an AK47. Winnie Mandela is an example that women can carry an AK47.” He said Madikizela-Mandela, who died on 2 April, after a long illness, was proof that women could do better than men. “The first female President must come from the EFF to demonstrate that we are not scared of women. We see them as equals. We do not see them as the ANC, as a tool to be used in the bedroom.” Malema told his members to see women leaders as soldiers who were equal to their male counterparts.

People say here that you were given [former President [Jacob] Zuma by Malema. Zuma became Deputy President of the ANC in 1997 in Mafikeng when Winnie Madikizela-Mandela was prevented from contesting.” If Madikizela-Mandela was allowed to contest in 1997, “we would have not have had Zuma today. They gave us Zuma in 1997”. He pointed out that negative criticism of Madikizela-Mandela emerged since her death and added: “We want to say to the leadership of the EFF, you must never be like this leadership of patriarchal men of the ANC and treat women of the EFF the way the ANC treated an African woman.” ‘Gigantic tree’ Comparing Madikizela-Mandela to a tree that had fallen, he said: “We gather today with our hearts filled with painful sorrow in this dark hour of our people’s loss.

The pain of human suffering perpetrated by those that wage the gardens of hatred, unethical oppression and mass murder.” He said that despite the heavy winds meant to imprison, torture and break down the tree, it still blossomed into flowers of love and tenacity. “It was the tree which was home to many freedom birds, because they were residents of its million branches. “Today, this tree has fallen.” – News24
