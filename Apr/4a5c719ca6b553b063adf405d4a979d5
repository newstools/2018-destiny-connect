A security guard from the Sandton Skye apartments has disputed seeing Karabo Mokoena laying on the floor with pills scattered around her During proceedings at the South Gauteng High Court on Wednesday, guard Isaac Mabasa told the court that when he opened Sandile Mantsoe’s apartment he did not see Mokoena on the floor with pills. A year ago, Mokoena was found murdered in a ditch, allegedly at the hands of of ex-boyfriend Mantsoe. Her body had been doused with petrol, a tyre placed around her, and then set alight. State Prosecutor Mike Hlatswayo called Constable Pule Khotelo to the stand, who told the court that he went to the Skye apartments to look for an entry in the occurrence book after he saw a statement made by Mantsoe which said he asked the security guards to open for him because he had left his key inside.
