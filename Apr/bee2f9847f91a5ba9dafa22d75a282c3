Radio and TV personality Gareth Cliff will play host and Roast Master at Comedy Central's Roast of Somizi later this month The shock DJ has never been one to mince his words and there’s no doubt he won’t be holding back the punches against the man he describes as his “brother from another mother”. Cliff will lead the panel of roasters, which includes the outspoken Ntsiki Mazwai and comedian Schalk Bezuidenhout. “It’s all about entertaining people. The audience can expect dirty, nasty and funny jokes. Nobody cares, least of all Somizi. So if you think someone is going to walk away from this hurt and saddened, then you’re watching the wrong show – that’s what soap operas are for,” he said.
