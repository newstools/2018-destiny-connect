The International Association of Athletes Federation (IAAF) on Thursday announced changes to female testosterone regulations that have far reaching implications for SA's golden girl Caster Semenya The new rules, which apply to all women competing in races ranging between 400m and a mile, will force Semenya to take medication to reduce the levels of testosterone in her body if she wishes to continue competing professionally. The new regulations require any athlete who has a Difference of Sexual Development (DSD) that means her levels of circulating testosterone (in serum) are five (5) nmol/L or above and who is androgen-sensitive to meet the following criteria to be eligible to compete in Restricted Events in an International Competition (or set a world record in a Restricted Event at competition that is not an International Competition): READ MORE: Caster Semenya clinches gold medal at Commonwealth Games (a) she must be recognised by law either as female or as intersex (or equivalent); (b) she must reduce her blood testosterone level to below five (5) nmol/L for a continuous period of at least six months (eg., by use of hormonal contraceptives); and (c) thereafter she must maintain her blood testosterone level below five (5) nmol/L continuously (ie: whether she is in competition or out of competition) for so long as she wishes to remain eligible. The new regulations will come into effect on 1 November. IAAF president Sebastian Cole said the watchdog had the responsibility to “ensure a level playing field for athletes”. “This means we need to be clear about the competition criteria for these two categories. Our evidence and data show that testosterone, either naturally produced or artificially inserted into the body, provides significant performance advantages in female athletes,” he said.
