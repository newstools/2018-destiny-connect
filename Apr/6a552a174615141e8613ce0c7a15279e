In the post, J went on to explain that he ended up finishing his BCom in Business Science and was then invited to Joburg by his cousin, who helped get him a job.

I ended up managing a studio and cleaning the studio rooms and setting them up for the big stars that walked through the doors (people like Hugh Masekela, Joyous, Brian Temba, Jamali, Sipho Hotstix, etc)… I did that job with such passion and commitment, honoured to be in the presence of all these stars,” he wrote. The muso ended his inspiring post by thanking his cousin for “opening the door” for him. “Thank you for offering me your couch for so long and helping me buy my first car (a pimping Tazz),” he added. – The Juice
