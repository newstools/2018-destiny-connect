High unemployment is a major obstacle to achieving the goals set in South Africa's National Development Plan (NDP), the spokesperson for an entrepreneurship competition co-sponsored by Sanlam said on Thursday The NDP, which the government launched in 2012, is a detailed blueprint for how the country can eliminate poverty and reduce inequality by 2030, but critics says this will not be achieved while economic growth remains lacklustre, keeping unemployment high at around 27 percent of the labour force. “Raising employment levels and expanding the tax base so that there are enough taxpayers and contributors to ensure the sustainability of social protection is imperative for reaching NDP goals,” said the spokeswoman for the 2018 Entrepreneur of the Year competition, Gugu Mjadu. “Current and future entrepreneurs need to be nurtured and supported as they are critical for building a strong, dynamic small and medium-sized enterprises [SME] sector and creating much-needed jobs. Both government and business have a key role to play in making this a reality.” READ MORE: Ramaphosa launches Yes initiative to address youth unemployment Mjadu said the significant role of private-sector competitions like the 2018 Entrepreneur of the Year in nurturing entrepreneurs and developing the SME sector could not be underestimated. “For 30 years, the competition has been recognising and rewarding generations of young South African entrepreneurs. It has helped to position entrepreneurship as a viable and aspirational career,” she said. The competition is open to all South African-based businesses. – African News Agency
