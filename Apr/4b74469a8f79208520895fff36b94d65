Tshwane Mayor Solly Msimanga delivered his State of the Capital Address during a special council sitting on Thursday Msimanga kicked off his address by paying tribute to late anti-apartheid struggle stalwart Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, who died in Johannesburg earlier this month. “Before we get to the business of the day, I would like to pay tribute to Mama Winnie Nomzamo Madikizela-Mandela… a woman of courage, a woman of strength who passed on 2 April. Many of us have learnt patience and strength from her – a woman who has taught the black child that it is possible,” said Msimanga. The anti-apartheid activist and ex-wife of the late President Nelson Mandela died at the Milpark Hospital in Johannesburg. She was 81. At the beginning of the council proceedings, Speaker Rachel Mathebe had a difficult time getting the programme in motion as members of the opposition ANC and the EFF kept singing and heckling each other.
