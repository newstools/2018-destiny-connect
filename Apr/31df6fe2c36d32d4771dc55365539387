M-Net (DStv 101) is due to begin airing the latest season of Survivor SA on Thursday, 3 May at 7pm Filming of M-Net’s latest season of Survivor SA, by production company Afrokaans, Survivor SA: Philippines, took place earlier this year with host Nico Panagio. It is billed to have more episodes and surprises than before – as well as something unbelievable. SABC3 has also set the starting date of the next season of the American version for four days later on Monday, 7 May at 7.30pm. Fingers crossed that Survivor Cambodia: Second Chance will actually start on 7 May on SABC3, since the channel has had to deal with payment issues, delays and postponements, and technical playout issues with basically every season of Survivor over the past three years.
