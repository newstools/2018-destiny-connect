Caster Semenya won gold in the women’s 1500m in a personal best time and games record at the Commonwealth Games on the Gold Coast in Australia, on Tuesday In a time of four minutes 0.71 seconds (4:00.71), it was also a new South African record, breaking the 4:01.81 mark set by Zola Budd back in 1984. Kenya’s Beatrice Chepkoech was second in 4:03.09 with Melissa Courtney of Wales taking bronze in 4:03.44. Due to faulty starting equipment, the athletes were forced to wait around for several minutes before getting the race underway. Beginning at a steady pace in the middle of the pack in lane two in wet conditions, the 800m Olympic champion Semenya was comfortable holding back in her less-favoured event.
