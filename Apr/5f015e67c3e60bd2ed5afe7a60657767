The Comedy Central Roast of Somizi just got hotter with the addition of Nomzamo Mbatha and DJ Fresh added to the panel of roasters With less than two weeks until the live taping of the show, Comedy Central has just turned up the heat on a blazing fire. Who better to rip into Somgaga than his Metro FM colleague and breakfast show co-host DJ Fresh, aka “Big Dawg” and he says it’s “GAYm ON Dzoll”. “As someone that not only loves Comedy Central Roasts, but actually owns copies of all of them to date, it’s quite surreal to be a panellist for the Comedy Central Roast of Somizi,” he says. Mbatha says it’s going to quite the challenge out-shading the King of Shade, but she says she’s up to the task. “I hope I can be funny and cheeky without trying too hard because I think throwing shade is a skill and an art,” she says.

I ain’t afraid of s***: in fact, is Somizi ready?” Skhumba asked.
