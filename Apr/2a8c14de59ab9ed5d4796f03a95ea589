There are few staple pieces as easy to wear as a white button-down shirt Not only is this wardrobe staple classic and simple, but it’s also versatile. Here are few tips to wear it. Tucked into a pleated skirt For a more put-together and professional look, tuck a crisp white shirt into an elegant pleated skirt.  Complete the look with a tote bag and ankle-strap heels.   Under a sleeveless dress Give your sleeveless dress a new silhouette for work by layering a shirt under it for a two-piece combination that is chic and classic. Tie it up Transform your figure in a few seconds by knotting your button-down shirt around your waist to accentuate it and create a fun, casual look.   Bralette over a shirt Dare to be different and style the white shirt underneath a bralette to create a sharp and contemporary look – all you need is a pair of mum jeans and a bag.   Let loose Keep it simple, functional and cool, with a borrowed-from-the-boys look. Leave the shirt untucked and a baggy for a more relaxed appearance.
