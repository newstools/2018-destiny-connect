Bonang Matheba stole the show at a charity gala dinner held in celebration of Nelson Mandela's centenary in London on Tuesday night Dressed in a strikingly bold yellow and black evening dress, Bonang looked breathtaking in snaps she shared of herself on the red carpet. She was in London to host the Global Gift Nelson Mandela Centenary Dinner, held in honour of Madiba. She attended the gala event alongside Hollywood A-listers such as Vanessa Williams and Pamela Anderson, and singer Beverley Knight. Before jetting off to the UK to host the prestigious event she attended for the first time last year and that’s in aide of celebrating Mandela’s centenary year as well as his humanitarian and philanthropic efforts, Bonang said she was honoured by the opportunity. “Celebrating Madiba on such a global scale fills my heart with so much joy. I am beyond honoured to be part of an evening of hope,” she said. Check out “your girl B” hob-knobbing with the entertainment industry’s who’s who:
