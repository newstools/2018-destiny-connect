I was wiser to lose the weight first this time around,” she says.  Siba –who has long spoken about her desire to have a big family – already has three children, sons Lonwabo and Linamandla (born in 2012 and 2014 respectively) and two-year-old Buhlebenkosi, her daughter.

They hop on along the way, but they don’t change the direction you’re headed.’ It means life must not stop because [of] them. They just simply join the journey and enjoy the ride with you,” she advises. You can catch Siba on Season 2 of The Wedding Bashers on M-Net.
