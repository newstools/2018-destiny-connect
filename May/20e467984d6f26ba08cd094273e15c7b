Take a look at the bridal make-up that made Diana, Kate and Meghan glowing brides on their big days Diana, Kate and Meghan may have shared the fairytale in walking down the aisle toward their very own Prince Charmings, however time and personalities have lent themselves to wedding looks that centre around the personalities of these brides. We reminisce on the splendor and charm of our favourite royal beauties on their wedding days. Diana, Princess of Wales Lady Diana Spencer walked down the aisle toward her prince under the watchful eyes of over 750 million people in 1981 and yet the similarities between her bridal make-up and that of the radiant Meghan Markle 37 years later show that simply being yourself makes all the difference in creating a beautiful blushing bride. While a light brushing of blush was the order of the day on Diana’s cheeks, Diana’s youth and own beauty radiated through her bridal make-up which was kept to a minimum and created to accent her blue eyes, with her mascara being heavily applied to magnify them. Kate, Duchess of Cambridge For her own 2011 bridal facebeat, Kate Middleton famously chose to do her own make-up for her walk down the aisle, emphasising her eyes with a pronounced liner and soft charcoal eyeshadow, while also adding quite a bit of blush to her cheeks and a nude gloss to her lips.   Meghan, Duchess of Sussex Meghan enlisted renowned make-up artist Daniel Martin to create her bridal look, opting for fresh-faced, natural beauty. With her freckles showing through her make-up, Meghan’s glowing skin and bare lips were complemented by soft brown eyeshadow and very subtle blush.
