The Gauteng social development department says it will pursue the person who raped a two-month-old baby after the infant's mother recently received a life sentence for shielding the rapist from authorities Last month, the 29-year-old mother of the victim, known only as Baby M, was sentenced in the South Gauteng High Court in Johannesburg, despite the rapist not yet being identified. Social Development MEC Nandi Mayathula-Khoza is expected to brief the media on Monday on their plans to pursue justice for the South African-born Mozambican baby. The department said it had brought the baby from Mozambique last and placed her in protective custody through a court order. At the time the baby’s mother was sentenced, police spokesperson Brigadier Vish Naidoo said the life term would serve as a deterrent to prevent others from shielding criminals.

Naidoo said medical tests revealed the baby had been raped. The mother was arrested and charged with aiding and abetting, in terms of the Child Protection Act, child abuse and defeating the ends of justice. Mayathula-Khoza will on Monday also unveil femicide awareness campaigns. – News24Wire
