President Cyril Ramaphosa has noted "with deep concern" the USA's decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal, calling it a step backwards US President Donald Trump announced on Tuesday that his country would withdraw from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) between the P5 +1 and the Islamic Republic of Iran. The P5 + 1 was made up of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council, China, France, Russia, UK, USA – plus Germany. Ramaphosa said: “As a matter of principle, and deeply rooted in its foreign policy, South Africa supports multilateral diplomacy and the peaceful resolution of conflict. “The JCPOA is a significant achievement in this regard. It provides a framework of confidence under which the Islamic Republic of Iran can pursue the development of its nuclear capabilities for civilian purposes.” He said the agreement was established in the interest of regional and international peace and security.

He added that, despite the US government withdrawing from the agreement, it should not prevent the remaining parties from honouring their commitments.
