Retail bank Capitec on Tuesday disputed a claim by rival FNB that it had become the first bank in South Africa to introduce a mini-ATM that uses biometrics as a means of validation for consumers “Capitec was in fact the first bank in South Africa to introduce biometric verification technology, back in 2012,” said Charl Nel, Head of Communications at Capitec. “The technology has always been a core part of the bank’s business model and currently Capitec is the only bank in South Africa which has biometrics recorded for its complete client base of over 10 million people. All client fingerprints have been verified with the Department of Home Affairs.” FNB said it had not received any official correspondence on the matter. “Upon receiving such communication, we will liaise directly with the relevant bank,” said Lee-Anne van Zyl, CEO of FNB Points of Presence.
