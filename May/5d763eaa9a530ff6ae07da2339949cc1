Chance the Rapper descended on Johannesburg earlier this week as part of a Castle Lite brand experience that had tens of thousands of music fans hoarse with excitement Glitter boots, Beyonce body stockings and world class hip hop and rap acts – the #CasteLiteUnlocks experience headlined by Chicago-born star Chance the Rapper earlier this week was one for the books. The lyrical cherry on top had to be Chance bringing out the Grammy-award winning Soweto Gospel Choir as part of a set that included his hit song Blessings. This was after his performance of Same Drugs which had Joburg’s Ticketpro Dome singing as one. The line-up of opening acts was generous, including Shane Eagle, Nadia Nakai, Frank Casino and cameos by Nasty C, Cassper Nyovest, Youngsta CPT and Emtee. PH, Major League, Ms Cosmo & Ayanda MVP also performed in a DJ booth suspended in an LED screen several storeys high. Local celebs including Dineo Moeketsi, Ayanda Thabethe, Slikour and Khanyi Mbau were among those munching on sliders and Castle Lite cocktails in the mezzanine VIP section. Becky Opdyke, Castle Lite Brand Director, said in a statement that the brand looked forward to more history-making concerts. “We thank the South African consumer for always supporting Castle Lite in delivering yet another extraordinary Unlocks concert. We’re about giving Citizens of Extra Cold once in a lifetime experiences and from Shane Eagle’s epic performance to Chance the Rapper’s shut down, the Unlocks concert delivered just that. We really look forward to making more history in the upcoming years, together with our loyal supporters,” Opdyke said. See more pics from the event in our gallery below.
