Speaking on Talk Radio 702, the girl’s tearful mother said her daughter was at home nursing her bruises and not writing her exams as she was still traumatised by the experience. Moyane had often been emotionally abusive to her child, she added. “Yes, it is true what has been written in the newspapers. Moyane has not tried to contact me, he blocked my contact long ago so I don’t have access to talk to him,” she said. “[My daughter] is still emotional. [Moyane] has not been physical, but has always been emotionally abusive to my child,” she added.
