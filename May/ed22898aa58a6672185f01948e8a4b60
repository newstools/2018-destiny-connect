Empire actress Taraji P Henson says "yes" to athlete partner Kevin Hayden After being together for a little over two years, Hayden got down on one knee and proposed. He gave his partner a Cartier love bracelet to go with it. Alongside a photo of her gorgeous ring and some chocolate-dipped strawberries, Henson wrote: “I said yes y’all!!! He started with the Cartier love bracelet BUT that was my #Mothersday gift and then he dropped to his knee and I almost passed out!!!”   After keeping their relationship under the radar, Henson only confirmed that she had been dating Hayden for two years during an episode of Essence‘s podcast Yes, Girl! in December.
