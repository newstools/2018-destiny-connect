Minister in the Presidency Responsible for Women Bathabile Dlamini on Wednesday denounced the alleged abuse of domestic worker Catherine Wiro by her high-profile employer, Mduduzi Manana Wiro quit her job after the former Deputy Minister of Higher Education and Training allegedly pushed her down the stairs at his Fourways residence. She is accusing Manana, who is an ANC MP, of assault, crimen injuria and intimidation. The 43-year-old domestic worker has reported the matter to the Douglasdale Police Station, but fearing for her life, she said she has since withdrawn her complaint. “We categorically denounce and are against any form of violence against women under whatever circumstances. The fight against gender-based violence remains our fundamental commitment,” Dlamini said in a statement issued on her behalf by the Presidency. Dlamini said she was aware that on 7 May 2018, Manana issued a statement in which he announces his intention to “file a legal suit against the Wiro family for extortion as they demanded an amount of R100 000”.

The allegations of violence have resurfaced against Mr Manana, who as a leader, has been entrusted by the public to represent them at the Parliament of the Republic,” said Dlamini. “Such a leader must, therefore, live his life as a living reflection of the aspirations of our Constitution. At the same time, we are concerned by allegations of extortion levelled against the Wiro family by Mr Manana.” In September last year, Manana pleaded guilty to assaulting three women at a nightclub in Fourways. He was sentenced to 12 months in prison or a fine of  R100 000, as well as 500 hours of community service. Manana was also ordered to undergo counselling. As a result of the conviction, he lost his Deputy Minister job. Dlamini urged “all parties involved to submit themselves to law enforcement processes in order for the matter to be addressed by our judicial system”.
