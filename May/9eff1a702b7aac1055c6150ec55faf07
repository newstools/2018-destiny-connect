Menlyn Park Shopping Centre has become a hotspot for a fashion-forward, trendsetting community that has a love for all things African The centre, recently named the home of Project Runway SA, is designed to offer Africa’s most unique shopping experience, with more than 300 stores spread over 17 000 square metres. As the largest mall in Africa, it comes as no surprise that Menlyn houses over 21 stores that focus solely on local designers and brands. “As the biggest fashion hub on the continent, we are all about supporting local talent and business. We want to be the springboard that many of our young designers need to become the next international fashion label. Our foot traffic through the walkways gives these local brands the visibility they need to grow,” says Olive Ndebele, GM of Menlyn Park Shopping Centre. As local designers, prints and brands receive more international exposure, Menlyn Park Shopping Centre aims to be the one-stop venue of choice for all your fashion requirements.
