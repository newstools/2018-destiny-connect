As the world counts down to the wedding of the year, we wait with bated breath to see whether American beauty and bride-to-be Meghan Markle will break with any traditions The royal family certainly are stiflers for detail and tradition, so while we might secretly be hoping that Markle and Prince Harry bring a touch of something unexpected to wedding proceedings, this is unlikely to happen. From the dress to the tiara and the couple’s first kiss, there are age-old protocols to be observed. Here are some of the things you can expect to see on Saturday. The dress Modesty is a mantra every woman joining the royal family must live by, so you definitely won’t be seeing any cleavage or excessive skin. If you look back in history, royal wedding gowns have typically been long-sleeved and avoid showing off the shoulders, with princesses in recent decades opting for the classic covered-up look.  Prince Harry’s grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, wore a long-sleeved satin dress to her wedding to Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, while Harry’s mum, the late Princess Diana, wore a voluminous, ruffled silk taffeta dress with dramatic sleeves.  Kate Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge, kept with tradition, wearing a gorgeous long-sleeved lace gown on her big day.  The tiara It’s unclear whether Markle will borrow one of the Queen’s diamond tiaras, a Cartier Halo tiara – as Middleton did – or wear one of Diana’s, but you can expect to see her wearing one.  After all, what’s a princess without her tiara? The first kiss Don’t expect a kiss from the happy couple during the ceremony at the St George’s Chapel on the grounds of Windsor Castle. Unlike Prince William and Kate’s kiss, staged on a balcony outside Kensington Palace, Meghan and Harry are expected to share their first kiss as a married couple after they emerge from the chapel and greet the thousands of people expected to be gathered outside.
