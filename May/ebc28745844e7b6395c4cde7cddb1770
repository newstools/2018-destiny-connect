In keeping with the bank’s simple approach to doing business, there’s no paperwork required to take out a policy and Capitec is incentivising consumers by offering a discount on premiums for policies taken out through its app, priced at R25 per month, compared to R40 if you apply at a branch. The bank is promising pay-out within four hours, provided all documentation required is in order, and if you’re a new customer, Capitec will waive the waiting period, meaning that if a natural death occurs within the first six months of the new policy coming into effect, you will still be covered.
