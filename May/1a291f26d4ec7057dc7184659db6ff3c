South Africans came out in firm support of the former Springbok player and SuperSport analyst for standing up for himself Willemse staged a spectacular walkout during the post match analysis of the Lions’ Super Rugby win against the Brumbies on Saturday following an apparent off-air clash with fellow analysts Naas Botha and Nick Mallet. At this stage it’s unclear exactly what caused the tension, but it was clear that for Willemse it was a matter of ‘this far and no further’. As if unleashing years of pent up frustration and pain, Willemse held no punch back. “I played this game for a long time, like all of us here. As a player I was labelled a quota player for a long time,” he began. “I’ve worked hard to earn my respect in this game, so I’m not going to be patronised by two players who played in Apartheid – a segregated era – who come and want to undermine me.” READ MORE:Solidarity, AfriForum to challenge legality of sports quotas As he delivered his speech, he walked towards the desk where the two men and show host Motshidisi Mohono were seated, dropped his papers on the desk and unclipped his microphone. “I can’t work with people that undermine other people. And you can sit and you can laugh about it, but you know exactly what happened. And it’s fine, I don’t mind being ridiculous. I’m glad it happened on air so people can see, because you two sit here …” he said as he walked off.
