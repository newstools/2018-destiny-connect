Shoprite has come out quickly to apologise for a Mother's Day display that had South Africans seeing flames Following public outrage and facing allegations of sexism, the Shoprite group has moved to explain that the display – which featured a range of cleaning products contained around a framed display labelled “Gifts to wow mom” – was photographed out of context. The retail giant claims that at the time the picture was taken, staffers were in the process of moving a Mother’s Day display – that included dishwashing liquid, multi-purpose cleaner, bleach and furniture spray – had been set up at the back of the shop to the front of the shop and while the frame was in place, the correct products were not yet on display. The store in question has been identified as Checkers Van Der Lingen in Paarl. Shoprite apologised for the blunder on Wednesday and tweeted a few images of what the display should look like.  “The Mother’s Day photo circulating on social media was taken at the Checkers Van Der Lingen store in Paarl on Friday, 4 May 2018, while the store was moving a Mother’s Day display from the back to the front of the store ahead of Mother’s Day this Sunday,” the retailer said. “The merchandise was moved and the posters were only moved afterwards. During the re-merchandising, the photo circulated was taken. We understand how the original photo could be misconstrued and for that, we apologise.”  Twitter users had a field day with the gaffe.
