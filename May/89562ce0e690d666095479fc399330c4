Meghan (nee Markle), Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Sussex, chose a classic, off-white Givenchy gown with a simple boat neck for her nuptials to Prince Harry on Saturday Kensington Palace announced in a tweet shortly after the Duchess arrived at the church that her ivory dress had been designed by British designer Clare Waight Keller, the first female Artistic Director at the acclaimed French fashion house of Givenchy. It put to bed any suggestions that she would choose an American designer for her special day. Keller was present as Meghan arrived at the chapel, helping her out of the car and adjusting her dress before she walked up the stairs, with adorable twin pageboys holding her train.  Meghan drove to the venue with her mother, Doria Ragland, showing the gathered crowds a hint of her wide boat neck, officially called a bateau neckline, and the Filigree Tiara she wore on her head, on loan from Queen Elizabeth. Last seen in public in the 1800s, it initially belonged to Queen Mary.  The dress was fitted above the waist with a three-quarter sleeve, widening at her hips into a slim A-line that extended into a monarch-length train – just over 2,5 metres. Her five-metre long veil was edged in intricate embroidery and its length could well have been a nod to Princess Diana’s memorably long veil and train. The embroidery on Meghan’s veil incorporated motifs from all the countries in the Commonwealth.  Ragland wore a pale green outfit with her long dreadlocks tucked into a jaunty off-centre hat. The wool crepe dress and coat from Oscar da la Renta got almost as many positive mentions as the fact that the 61-year-old Ragland kept her nose ring as part of her wedding attire. The Queen also chose green, opting for a shade of lime and accented with purple blooms on her hat.  See more images below.         Images: Getty and Sky News
