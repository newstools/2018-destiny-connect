There are now 45 confirmed or suspected Ebola cases recorded in the Democratic Republic of the Congo At least 23 victims have died. The World Health Organisation is flying an experimental Ebola vaccine to the Democratic Republic of Congo. However, many local people still don’t know much about the epidemic – or the risks. The outbreak was announced last week in the remote rural area of Bikoro. So far, 45 cases have been reported and 25 people are known to have died. But cases have also been confirmed in Mbandaka, about 150km away, which is home to almost 1,2 million people.

The Ebola virus was first identified in 1976 near the Ebola River in what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Since then, the virus has emerged periodically and infected people primarily in African countries, with some cases also reported in the US, UK, Russia, Italy and Spain, according to the Centre of Disease Control and Prevention. The largest number of fatalities were recorded in a 2014-2016 outbreak in West Africa, with 4 809 people killed in Liberia, 3 956 in Sierra Leone and 2 543 in Guinea.
