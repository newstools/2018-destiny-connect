The National Health Education and Allied Workers' Union (Nehawu) Gauteng deputy secretary Gracia Rikhotso on Wednesday rejected as false reports that Charlotte Maxeke Hospital would shut down because its members were going to embark on a strike. The National Health Education and Allied Workers Union (Nehawu) on Wednesday said reports that Charlotte Maxeke Hospital in Parktown, Johannesburg would shut down because its members planned to embark on a strike were false. The Democratic Alliance (DA) this week warned that the hospital faced a possible shutdown with staff downing tools over non-payment of overtime and performance bonuses. There were also concerns about unfilled vacancies. However, on Wednesday morning the union’s Gauteng deputy secretary Gracia Rikhotso denied that their members were embarking on a strike and distanced the union from last week’s vandalism of the hospital, which she blamed on “criminal elements” who took advantage of a lunchtime protest.

The hospital, which has secured a court interdict preventing staff from going on strike, has already been cleaned. Fears of a possible shutdown prompted DA MPL Jack Bloom to say on Tuesday: “I am extremely concerned by threats that the Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Hospital will be closed by striking workers this Wednesday. Staff and patients have told me that these threats have been widely publicised in the hospital and are causing anxiety.” – African News Agency
