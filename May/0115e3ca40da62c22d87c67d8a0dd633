Rihanna launched a fun, ephemeral and also gorgeously practical range of panties, bras and negliges on Friday to high praise The collection encompasses sexy, fur-edged gowns in lilacs and sea-greens but also a comfy-looking range of panties and bras in skin tones as varied as RiRi’s foundations. We especially love the variety of panty styles – from ‘thong’ and ‘cheeky’ to ‘hipster’ and ‘high waist’. The line includes corsets, bodysuits, rompers, robes and accessories like crops, handcuffs and satin restraints. Rihanna has been teasing about the collection for weeks on her social media pages and the hype for the line was predictably manic with the website issuing waiting notices to visitors and later crashing. The prices on the Savage x Fenty site are reasonable – especially considering the label. T-shirt bras are just over R550 and the fancier embroidered or lacy bras are over R700. The microfibre panties are around the R200 mark. Rihanna told Vogue earlier this year that she hoped women bought her items for themselves. “Women should be wearing lingerie for their damn selves,” she said. “I want people to wear Savage x Fenty and think, I’m a bad bitch. I want women to own their beauty.” The line incorporates bra sizes from 32A to 44DD, while the lingerie, panties, and loungewear is available in sizes from XS to 3XL. International shipping is available in 210 countries (including South Africa). A membership program, costing about R600 a year, allows subscribers access to launches, limited-edition items, and free shipping.
