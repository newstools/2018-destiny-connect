Controversial City of Tshwane Chief of Staff Marietha Aucamp quit her job on Thursday after being asked to do so by Mayor Solly Msimanga “I note that Ms Marietha Aucamp has formally tendered her resignation from her position as the Chief of Staff in the Office of the Executive Mayor of Tshwane after having been asked to do so,” Msimanga said in a statement. Both Msimanga and Aucamp have come under severe criticism after it emerge that the latter was not qualified for the top municipal post, and that the mayor had been instrumental in her securing the job. The opposition in Tshwane, the ANC, has opened a fraud case against Aucamp at the Pretoria police station. On Thursday evening, Msimanga said he had no option but to elbow Aucamp out of the job.
