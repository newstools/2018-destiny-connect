British Airways said on Tuesday it would begin flying three times a week directly from Durban to London from 29 October “The service will be the only non-stop link between Europe and Durban and will be operated by the airline’s newest aircraft, the Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner,” it said. “The aircraft will arrive at King Shaka International in the morning and land back at Heathrow in the evening.” British Airways Commercial Manager in Southern Africa Sue Petrie said the direct flights would help grow international tourism to KwaZulu-Natal and provide a more convenient alternative for the province’s business travellers and holidaymakers wanting to get to the UK and Europe. KwaZulu-Natal MEC for Economic Development, Tourism and Environmental Affairs Sihle Zikalala said the direct flight would allow the province to showcase its capital Durban and unlock “enormous” business potential.
