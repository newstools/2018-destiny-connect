The South Gauteng High Court in Johannesburg will on Wednesday hear arguments from both the defence and prosecution teams in the trial of Sandile Mantsoe, who is accused of killing his ex-girlfriend Karabo Mokoena in April 2017. The South Gauteng High Court in Johannesburg will on Wednesday hear arguments from both the defence and prosecution teams in the trial of Sandile Mantsoe, who is accused of killing his former girlfriend Karabo Mokoena in April 2017. Acting judge Peet Johnson announced this week during court proceedings that he would deliver his verdict after the  arguments. On Monday, the defence made a surprise move by closing its case without calling any witnesses to testify. Mantsoe’s lawyer, Victor Simelane, did not give reasons to the court for the decision. “Is he aware that he could be sentenced to life imprisonment?” the judge asked Simelane.

During a short adjournment, Simelane told reporters that the State had not proven its case beyond reasonable doubt and therefore, “we are not going to help them”. Mokoena’s charred remains were found by a passer-by in Lyndhurst, Johannesburg on April 29, 2017. Mantsoe has painted Mokoena as a violent person who was “addicted” to the high life.

He also alleged that Mokoena used to cut herself, and that her sister had witnessed it. Mantsoe faces charges of premeditated murder, defeating the ends of justice, and assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm for allegedly assaulting Mokoena on March 27, 2017.

Mantsoe, a married father of three, had reportedly been in a romantic relationship with Mokoena since October 2016. It is believed that he and his wife were estranged. The accused has denied killing Mokoena but, during his bail application, he said he disposed of her body after he came home and found that she had committed suicide. – News24
