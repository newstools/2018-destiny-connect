The attack on the Imam Hussain Mosque in Verulam, Durban, on Thursday has been described as a "heinous attack" and "totally unjustified" Three men stormed the mosque on Thursday afternoon, stabbing two people and slitting the throat of another man who died in hospital as a result of his extensive injuries. The Muslim Judicial Council of South Africa “vehemently condemned” the attack on the mosque. Shaykh Isgaak Taliep, Secretary-General of the Muslim Judicial Council, called the attack on the mosque a “senseless crime” against three innocent individuals. “We reiterate and emphasise the core Islamic teaching and principle of ‘respect for all human beings’,” Taliep said. “We… call on all communities to remain law-abiding citizens and refrain from any and all forms of vigilantism.” READ MORE: SA’s first ‘Open’ Mosque set alight Taliep said the council called on the police and other government structures to ensure the necessary criminal investigations are done so “the perpetrators and criminals can be brought to book and face the full might of the law”.
