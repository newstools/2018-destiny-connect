The EFF on Tuesday called on South Africa's government to expel the Israeli mission to the country over what it said was Israel's racist aggression against Palestinians Spokesperson Mbuyiseni Ndlozi said the EFF welcomed South Africa’s decision to recall its Ambassador to Israel in protest after more than 50 people – including children – were shot dead on Monday by Israeli soldiers as they protested in Gaza against the move of the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jeruselum. Ndlozi said the expulsion of the Israeli mission must form part of the first move towards an international isolation of Israel by the whole world. South Africa, which had benefited in the past from international boycotts against apartheid, must take the lead. “The Israeli government has refused the right of Palestinians to self-determination for far too long,” Ndlozi said. “It has imposed a military occupation on their land for over half a century. Palestinians live in a permanent racist and military occupation, despite many resolutions of the United Nations against Israel’s occupation.” READ MORE: Trade unions demand permanent withdrawal of Ambassador to Israel The boycott and isolation of Israel was the most efficient, and yet peaceful way of forcing that government to respect the human rights of Palestinian, the EFF spokesperson said. “South Africa must expel Israel’s Ambassadors with immediate effect until Israel ends its illegal occupation of Palestine,” said Ndlozi. – African News Agency
