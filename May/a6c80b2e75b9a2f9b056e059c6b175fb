The DA on Wednesday said it will file charges of corruption and extortion against disgraced ANC MP and convicted woman-beater Mduduzi Manana The DA’s Terri Stander said this comes after the release of a voice clip in which Manana can apparently be heard offering his former domestic worker Christine Wiro a R100 000 “consolation” payment in exchange for dropping assault charges against him. “In the clip, Mr Manana clearly attempts to offer Ms Wiro money in order to benefit himself and avoid further prosecution,” Stander said in a statement. “He clearly unlawfully and intentionally tried to take advantage of her by subjecting her to financial pressure.

He has broken his oath of office and taxpayers should not be made to pay the salary of a woman-abuser.” Stander said Manana obviously wanted to use his privileged position and tried to buy himself out of accountability. Manana is facing growing calls to step down in the wake of assault allegations against him by Wiro, who alleged that Manana tried to push her down the stairs for allowing a guest into his Fourways home without checking with him first.

Wiro has been in Manana’s employ for three weeks. She withdrew the charges on Monday after Manana offered to pay her R100 000 to drop the case. – African News Agency
