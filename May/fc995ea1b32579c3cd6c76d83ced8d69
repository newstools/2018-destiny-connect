SuperSport on Friday announced that Ashwin Willemse, Nick Mallett and Naas Botha will not be the in-studio presenters for Saturday's Super Rugby broadcast The statement from SuperSport reads: ‘We have had discussions this week with all parties in an effort to resolve this matter amicably and expeditiously. ‘Despite good progress initially, the matter has unfortunately not been resolved. We have therefore decided to instruct an independent Senior Counsel, Advocate Vincent Maleka, to chair a review of the incident which occurred and to make recommendations to our management. ‘Pending the outcome of the review, the three presenters involved will not appear on-air. None of the presenters have been suspended and they will continue to be remunerated in terms of their contracts.
