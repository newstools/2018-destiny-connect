Sandile Mantsoe is sentenced to 32 years imprisonment for murdering and burning the body of his ex-girlfriend. Sandile Mantsoe earlier told the South Gauteng High Court that he was sorry for burning his ex-girlfriend Karabo Mokoena’s body, reiterating that he did not kill her. Mokoena’s charred remains were found in Lyndhurst, Johannesburg in April 2017. ”I apologise to the family, the community and the people who look up to me… burning Karabo was a shortcoming,” he said in mitigation of sentence. Prosecutor Phakanyiswa Marasela asked him why he was apologising only after having been found guilty by the court. ”Why didn’t you give an apology here in front of everyone and family? What took you so long?” she asked. READ MORE: Karabo Mokoena’s murderer has been found guilty Mantsoe said he wrote a letter to the Mokoena family. ”It hasn’t taken long…I was incarcerated.
