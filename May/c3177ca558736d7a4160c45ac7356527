Local celebrities have pulled the wool over our eyes on several occasions as far as publicity stunts relating to their relationships are concerned. Here's a look at some of the most memorable ones Twitter went into overdrive on Monday as reports began surfacing that one of SA’s “it” media personality couples – Nomzamo Mbatha and Maps Maponyane – had called time on their unconfirmed three-year relationship. With the pair remaining mum for most of the day as “inside sources” claimed Mbatha was left devastated by Maponyane, who allegedly cheated on her, some are wondering whether the pair pulled a damage control, PR exercise with tweets exchanged between them.  In response, Maponyane assured her that indeed he was OK and that everything was going to be alright.  BOITY AND CASSPER Who can forget the 2015 PR stunt Boity and Cassper and a magazine pulled on us with a misleading headline that had us believing that the K’Sazoba Lit hitmaker had proposed to Boity, but he had in fact only asked her to be his girlfriend. They got us good though.   BONTLE AND PRIDDY UGLY Then there was Bontle and Priddy Ugly, who almost broke the Internet when pictures emerged of the couple seemingly from their traditional and white weddings. It turns out the couple had staged the whole thing for LaSauce’s music video for I Do.  BONANG AND AKA No couple did it better than AKA and Bonang, who concocted a February break-up strategy to get people talking and create hype over the weekend and into the following week, ahead of the release of his hit Caiphus Song. They did it so well, that when the couple broke up for real late last year, very few actually bought it initially.
