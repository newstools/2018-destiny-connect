Former deputy minister of Higher Education Mduduzi Manana is reportedly facing new allegations of assault and intimidation The ANC Member of Parliament allegedly tried to push his domestic worker down the stairs of his double-storey home in Fourways on Sunday. The Sowetan reports on Monday morning that Manana’s Zimbabwean helper, Christine Wiro, laid charges against the former deputy minister at the Douglasdale police station on Sunday night – just three weeks into her job. Wiro reportedly described Manana as a “very scary” man who was verbally abusive.

When she saw a car at the gate and a woman ringing the bell, she opened it thinking it was Manana’s guest. “He was shouting at me, saying I can’t open his gate for anyone without checking with him first. I apologised but he kept shouting at me, telling me that he had connections and can deport me back to Zimbabwe,” she was quoted as saying. She told the publication that working for Manana was characterised by long hours and verbal abuse. Gauteng police spokesperson Mathapelo Peters said they were investigating a case of common assault that was opened on Sunday, but could not divulge further information pending court proceedings.
