Renowned fashion stylist Ty Hunter gives us some tips and tricks on how to wear and style your man's clothes We had a pleasure of meeting Beyoncé’s personal stylist, Ty Hunter, on his recent visit to our shores for the #BeyGlamSquad collaboration with Woolworths South Africa. With the hot looks King B has been giving us on Instagram recently, we just had to chat with the guy responsible and get some advice.   We had a brief chat with Hunter about items you can wear from your man’s wardrobe and still look smashing. 1. Crisp white shirt This shirt can be styled in different ways. It can be worn as shirt dress with heels or thigh-high boots this winter or it can work for a casual day look with jeans and flats. Men’s shirt are better constructed and of higher quality.  2. Neck-tie and suspenders These give you a nice masculine look with a bit of a feminine touch. You can wear these with formal pants, or a full suit with a shirt and brogues.  3. Over-sized blazer It makes a lot of sense to wear his blazer this winter season, for warmth and smell of his cologne.
