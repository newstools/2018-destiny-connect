Last year in September, Manana was convicted of three counts of assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm after pleading guilty to the charges. This after three women were assaulted at Cubana in Fourways on August 6, which was filmed and went viral on social media, sparking an outcry and calls for his arrest. Manana claimed he was provoked after one of the women called him “isitabane“, a derogative term for a gay man.
