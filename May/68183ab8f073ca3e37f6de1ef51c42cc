The South Gauteng High Court in Johannesburg has found Sandile Mantsoe, guilty of killing his ex-girlfriend Karabo Mokoena. Mantsoe stabbed Mokoena and tried to hide the murder by burning her remains. Acting Judge Peet Johnson also found Mantsoe guilty of defeating the ends of justice and of assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm. Mokoena’s charred remains were found by a passer-by in Lyndhurst, Johannesburg in April 2017. Mantsoe previously claimed that Mokoena was a violent person, who was “addicted” to the high life.
