Acting provincial Secretary Susan Dantjie confirmed in a statement that the party accepted Mahumapelo’s resignation “with a sense [of] apprehension – but great pride”. “As an organisation, we will forever be appreciative and learn from his emphatic, principled, but simple approach to issues,” Dantjie said. “In his 35 years of revolutionary activism in the ANC, he has mastered the art of remaining simple and humble at all times, despite sustained concocted attacks against him by some friends and comrades.” READ MORE: ‘We want Supra out’ – fresh bid launched to oust NW Premier She said the party was confident he would continue his movement in whatever new role he was deployed to. “We urge him to remain steadfast in what he believes are the necessary tasks of executing the revolution,” she said.

He responded: “Packing my bags and going home from tomorrow.” His detractors have called for his entire provincial executive committee to also be disbanded. Pressure mounted on Mahumapelo to vacate his office after President Cyril Ramaphosa appointed an inter-ministerial task team to investigate the unfolding crisis. He has already placed the health department under national administration. Ramaphosa was expected to receive a report from the inter-ministerial team, led by Minister in the Presidency Dr Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, this week. – News24
