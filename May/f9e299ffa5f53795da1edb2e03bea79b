FNB said on Monday it had become the first bank in South Africa to introduce a mini-ATM that uses biometrics as a means of validation for consumers The device functions as a self-service kiosk from which customers can make withdrawals, transfers and payments, view statements, purchase airtime and electricity, and perform card cancellations. It also allows consumers to open new accounts by reading their thumb print. “The TouchPoint validates a customer’s identity by scanning a fingerprint placed on the biometric reader and it can detect false fingerprints to prevent fraud,” said Lee-Anne van Zyl, CEO of FNB Points of Presence. “The identity of the customer is then verified with the Department of Home Affairs to ensure the self-service account opening complies with the relevant laws.” READ MORE: FNB launches mobile bank account for unbanked consumers FNB said the device had been successfully piloted in Gauteng since November last year and the bank aimed to place the devices in branches, community retailers in townships and rural areas across South Africa. “The introduction of biometric validation on self-service devices is an important step to making banking much more accessible to South African communities,” said Van Zyl. “This is a continuation of our journey to broaden financial inclusion.” – African News Agency (ANA)
