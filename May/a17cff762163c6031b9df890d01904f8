A stay-at-home mum for decades, Nozipho Dube’s only exposure to business before launching her own enterprise at the age of 50 was volunteering on the board of two NGOs. Now this confident, capable entrepreneur is making her mark When the City of Cape Town gave Dube old banners in October 2014, a dream of creating practical, trendy and sustainable items was born, along with her textile business, Ecogift. Demand and profits grew quickly for its environmentally friendly pencil cases and shoppers. Pursuing her passion for making sustainable, protective wear was next on her agenda. “It was exciting and close to my heart. I’ve always been conscious of how we impact the planet. When I first began the business, we were using cotton for everything,” says Dube. Ecogift’s humble beginnings were a desk, a chair, a printer and a phone in a shared, rented office of an NGO. Today, she calls the likes of De Beers Marine a client. Check out Dube’s behind-the-scenes video for her feature in the May issue of DESTINY, on shelf now.
