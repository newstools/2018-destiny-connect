Self-declared members and supporters of the EFF, many wearing party T-shirts, attacked at least two Vodacom stores over the weekend, according to Business Insider SA. The owner of the Vodacom franchise at Mall of the North reported that three women were assaulted and goods stolen during the incursion. In a press statement, DA Member of the Limpopo Provincial Legislature, Jacques Smalle, threatened to open a case at the Polokwane police station at 8am on Monday against what he termed “EFF hooligans” who vandalised the store. “It is alleged that these EFF supporters vandalised the store while protesting against the image of Julius Malema and Floyd Shivambu shown at the Vodacom Journalist of the Year awards captioned ‘abusers of democracy’,” said Smalle. The DA condemned the incident and urged law enforcement units to investigate the matter and arrest members of the EFF, said Smalle. “This is clearly a sign of things to come for the EFF. If they don’t like something, as they have shown with their continued attack on the press, they will use violence and destruction at all costs,” he concluded. Responding to the DA, Buthane said the threats were an act by whites to continue “killing black dignity and black souls”. He noted that the leadership of the EFF in Limpopo have not issued any call for members to attack the store. “In all our spheres, from branches to national, [we] have never issued statements that said Vodacom must be attacked … even though there was an attack by Vodacom to our national leadership,” said Buthane. He said the party kept quiet and never even released a media statement against Vodacom.
