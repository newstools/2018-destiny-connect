At the event, one of many held this year in honour of the fifth anniversary of Madiba’s death, Ngozi Adichie said that memory was a complicated, “utterly subjective beast”. “I think humanising him, acknowledging that he wasn’t perfect, isn’t denigrating him. When we do that, we realise that there’s a lot that we ourselves can do. It seems like everyone tries to own him. Some have turned him into a sanitised glass urn. Others really engage with who he was and what he thought.”
