The suspects were arrested in KwaZulu-Natal and Limpopo on Friday on allegations of fraud and contraventions of the National Road Traffic Act. Seven of the suspects were from Limpopo and five from KwaZulu-Natal, RTMC spokesman Simon Zwane said on Sunday. The arrests followed raids conducted at private testing stations and a learner’s licence testing authority by the RTMC’s national traffic anti-corruption unit, jointly with the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigations (Hawks), the Special Investigations Unit (SIU), and the KwaZulu-Natal transport and traffic investigations unit, he said. Allegations against the Limpopo suspects, who included examiners of vehicles and data capture staff, were that they issued vehicle roadworthy certificates fraudulently for vehicles they had never physically inspected. The suspects are expected to appear in the Magistrate’s Courts in Musina and Thohoyandou. The five suspects arrested in KwaZulu-Natal would appear at the Durban Commercial Crimes Court. The suspects included four examiners of learner licences employed in Underberg and a manager formerly employed at another learner licence centre in Howick.
