The party accused Rupert of being arrogant, racist and suffering from cognitive dissonance on Tuesday evening during an event hosted by Power FM. The multi-billionaire was a guest on the Chairman’s Conversation, an annual event hosted by the radio station’s founder, Given Mkhari. Rupert, who is chair of the Swiss-based luxury goods company Richemont and South African-based company Remgro, faced tough questions from the Johannesburg crowd following a two-hour one-on-one conversation with Mkhari in which he touched on various topics including corruption, land expropriation, investor confidence, building a sustainable business and the Afrikaner Broederbond. When asked whether he thought the fact that his father had grown up during the great depression in South Africa had something to do with his drive and ultimate success in business, Rupert said yes. “That’s the reason. In a sense, the Afrikaner was downtrodden – the poor white question. But they were driven. They studied like crazy, they saved like crazy. They didn’t go and buy BMWs and hang around at [high-end Johannesburg night clubs] Taboo or The Sands all the time.” The EFF on Wednesday described Rupert as “an arrogant white Afrikaner who sees nothing beyond his selfish racist white capitalist interests”.
