“The President extends his personal condolences and those of government and the governing party to the family, friends, comrades and associates of Mr Msimang in South Africa and internationally among whom Mr Msimang was highly regarded,” the Presidency said. Msimang served as the London representative of the African National Congress (ANC) in the 1960s and almost three decades after his tenure. “Today we bow our heads and hearts in remembrance of our beloved Tat’ uMendi Msimang in whom South Africa has lost a servant-leader and patriot of great distinction. Tata Msimang was strong of character and principle, which he conveyed with humility and kindness,” Ramaphosa said.
