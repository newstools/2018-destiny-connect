Solely dependant on a social grant for survival, Keletso Nkoala has lived in a shack at Kwa-Sibi Village in Matatiele all her life. Until now. She is now a beneficiary of a Department of Human Settlements programme for Destitute and Vulnerable Groups that seeks to prioritise and fast-track housing provision â€“ specifically for the elderly, disabled, child-headed families and military veterans.
