One of the women and speakers at the event, Amanda Lusaseni said: “I think that for women, not a lot is being done when it comes to women empowerment. Many women as we speak right now are suffering.” Lusaseni said that it is not too late for women to get help and that this can only be done if people stand together to create a better future. “The most important thing South Africans can do is to start with the youth and make education the biggest starting point.” She said education is important because women need it to be and become economically free.
