Motsoaledi made the announcement on behalf of the National Health Council, a statutory body, which met on Thursday and Friday last week. “The council met to, among others, finalise and operationalise the presidential stimulus package as announced by the President [Cyril Ramaphosa]. This announcement, which will result in the filling of more than 5 300 posts in the health departments of the nine provinces from the beginning of January 2019, in addition to being a product of the presidential stimulus package, is also the implementation of the recommendations of the presidential health summit held a few weeks ago,” said Motsoaledi. “The president had announced the stimulus package to kick-start the economy. With regards to health, he had also stated that there will be a stimulus for health in three areas – human resources, hospital beds and hospital linen.”
