The South African Human Rights Commission has asked that Zuma be arrested and held in contempt of court for failing to fully honour a settlement agreement, made by order of the Equality Court, relating to “hate speech” remarks he made in July last year. In terms of the agreement, signed by Zuma in May this year, he was to pay two under-resourced schools R30 000 each and issue a written apology for his comments in which he accused Derek Hanekom and Pravin Gordhan of being sell-outs.
