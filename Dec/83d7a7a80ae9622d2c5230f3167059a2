Dineo Phaladi, a mine overseer at Anglo American subsidiary Kumba Iron Ore’s Kolomela mine, and Nompumelelo “Mpumi” Zikalala, the Deputy Chief Executive officer at De Beers Consolidated Mines, were selected from nearly 650 nominations from around the world. The pair were picked for persevering in the face of adversity, finding solutions to challenges and empowering others by being a voice and role model for diversity and inclusion, Anglo American said. The list aims to showcase the range of female talent within the global mining industry and to identify inspirational role models to encourage future generations of women to consider mining as a career choice. Phaladi was appointed as the first female mine overseer at Kolomela earlier this year – a role in which she ensures the health and safety of 120 people while achieving production targets.
