SAPS spokesperson Captain Kay Makhubele could not confirm reports of Arora’s car being sprayed with bullets. Arora was returning from the airport, where he had picked up a passenger from an international flight. Reliable sources with knowledge of the incident said that Arora was shot once in the hea, but Makhubele could only confirm that Arora was wounded in the upper body. “He managed to drive some distance on New Road, and came to a stop near the Engen garage,” Makhubele said. Speculation about the killing is already pointing to labour issues surrounding the liquidation of Westdawn Investment, which traded as JIC Mining, a source said. The company technically has no employees of its own, but acted as a labour broker between the Gupta-owned Optimum Coal Mine and Sethemba and Sabelo Coal – two other Gupta-linked mining companies, both subsidiaries of JIC.
