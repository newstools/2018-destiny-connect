“We are proceeding with an application to the Constitutional Court for leave to appeal,” advocate Peter Daubermann said in a text message to News24 on Tuesday. This after the SCA found that Daubermann’s application to have Judge Mandela Makaula recuse himself had “no reasonable prospect of success”. Omotoso and one of his co-accused, Lusanda Sulani, lodged the applications shortly after the State’s first witness, Cheryl Zondi, gave emotional testimony in the rape-accused pastor’s case. The pair, as well as Zukiswa Sitho, face 63 charges and 34 alternative charges, which include rape and sexual assault. Zondi filed for a leave of absence from the trial so that she could write her exams earlier in October.
