The party said in a statement on Monday that the invasion of the privacy of the EFF leadership and their families was an attempt to discredit the party and its objectives and it should not be tolerated. Malema’s wife and children live in a luxurious house owned by alleged tobacco smuggler Adriano Mazzotti, EWN reported . The house is reportedly situated in a high-security Hyde Park estate and is owned by Mazzotti, who is a director of cigarette-manufacturing company Carnilinx. The report by EWN does not give a specific address for Malema and his family, but author and investigative journalist Jacques Pauw published a picture and the address of the home on Twitter. Mazzotti has a long-standing friendship with Malema.
