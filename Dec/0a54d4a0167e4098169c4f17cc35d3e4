The new album has 12 songs, including a song for the times that discourages men from engaging in women and child abuse. The 30-year-old Maskandi singer, who sometimes sings in English, implores men to refrain from taking advantage of women and children simply because they are “stronger”. Other tracks on the new album are equally fresh and inspirational – the title track Ung’bambezelile – is a love song in which a lover laments the loss of a long-time and trusted love interest to another.
