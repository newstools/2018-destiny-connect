“Comair @British_Airways owes me a public apology & a new wheelchair,” he wrote on his social media platforms on Wednesday afternoon. Ndopu took to social media to voice his dissatisfaction about the damage to his power chair, which the airline’s ground staff allegedly caused when he took a trip to and from Durban. Ndopu recently became the first African with a degenerative disability to graduate from Oxford University, where he obtained a Master’s degree in public policy. “They damaged my state-of-the-art power chair on both legs of my trip to Durban, where ironically, I was invited by the @WorldBank to give a keynote on disability inclusion,” Ndopu wrote on his Facebook account and Twitter page.
