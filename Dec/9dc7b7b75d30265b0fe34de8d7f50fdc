A new South African Institute of Race Relations (SAIRR) poll shows that the governing ANC’s support has increased ahead of the 2019 general elections, while the country’s two biggest opposition parties, the DA and EFF, have lost ground. According to the poll results: • the ANC’s support in December comes in at 56%, up from 52% in September; • the DA’s support has declined to 18 % from 23% in September; and • the EFF is on 11%, down from 13% in September. Gareth van Onselen, head of politics and governance at the SAIRR, has emphasised that the poll is not a prediction, but is rather “a snapshot in time” of the electorate between 26 November and 4 December, 2018. The poll was conducted among 1 017 registered voters and according to the SAIRR, was “fully demographically representative”.
