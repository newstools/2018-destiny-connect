Festival-goers have told of brazen robberies, traffic chaos and a lack of public transport outside the concert venue and at the nearby Sasol garage in Nasrec, just over 1km from FNB Stadium, while they were waiting for transportation. Transport services such as the Gautrain said many of its buses were stuck in traffic while fares for e-hailing service Uber had more than quadrupled. On social media, people detailed how the precinct became a “war zone” as running battles ensued between criminals and showgoers, with many being robbed of their cellphones and other belongings, while young women waiting for their rides  at a nearby garage were harassed and nearly raped, allegedly with no security or police in sight. There were reports of a group of about 30 men using knives and guns to attack people and grab their belongings. The injuries included stab wounds and a broken nose. Johannesburg Member of the Mayoral Committee (MMC) for Public Safety, Michael Sun, said that the JMPD was responsible for traffic management and deployed 236 metro police officers/traffic wardens, 104 patrol vehicles, 18 motorbikes and 11 horses to ensure traffic free flow from 6am on Sunday to 7am on Monday, as part of the Venue Operation Centre (VOC) team.
