This historic event will see Flight SA1421 depart Johannesburg at 2pm and arrive in Mthatha at 3.30pm on Monday afternoon, with the return leg back to OR Tambo International Airport departing Mthatha at 4pm. Sonwabo Mbananga, spokesperson for the Eastern Cape government, said that this was in line with Premier Phumulo Masualle’s pronouncement during this year’s Mthatha Airshow in which he called for the aviation sector to take advantage of the untapped growth potential of the province, both from a travel and tourism perspective, as this industry value chain can play a big role in the economic growth of this less-developed part of the province.
