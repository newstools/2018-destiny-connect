As scary as bold colour can be sometimes (from the number 1 fan of an all-black look), there are certain times when it’s completely necessary. Mostly, when the sun is shining and we’re feeling all those warm summer vibes. However, we’re not about to invest in a bunch of colourful pieces we can’t also wear in winter! So to mentally prepare ourselves for the fun of outfit planning, we’ve found some incredible street style for inspo and a chilled 4th Street wine for, well, the same thing… Here are our fave #StreetsAreOurRunwayTrends for colour in summer! Linked to some great heritage prints, red is perfect year-round. When it’s a bit chillier, a pair of tartan overalls is ideal. But when it really heats up, we’ll turn to a sleeveless jumpsuit with white tee underneath. Matching accessories add extra fashion flair. Sunset hues are the ideal summer palette, with oranges, yellows and pinks featuring on standout dresses. Dress up or down depending on the occasion.
