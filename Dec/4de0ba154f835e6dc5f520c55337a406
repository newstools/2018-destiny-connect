He said South Africa regularly hosted international events, and what happened at the Sasol garage was an “exception”. Cele was responding to criticism over policing after the star-studded event and a sudden surge of a group of thieves at a Sasol garage near FNB Stadium, where people were waiting for transport. “Our planning was not extended to the Sasol garage, which is located plus-minus [3kms] away from the stadium,” he said. “However, unforeseen circumstances, like failure of traffic management and congestion of [the] mobile network, pushed fans to the garage, which resulted in the chaotic situation,” said Cele. Johannesburg Metro Police Department spokesperson Senior Superintendent Wayne Minnaar said he would not comment on the minister’s remarks.
