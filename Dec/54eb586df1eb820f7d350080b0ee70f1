During closing arguments on Tuesday at the Palm Ridge Magistrate’s Court, State prosecutor Jacki Steyn said: “If there was a problem with the principal, then the accused would not be investigated.” Molefe is facing three charges of rape and eleven of sexual assault, which he allegedly committed in 2017. While giving his testimony last week, Molefe said the case against him was a plot to remove him as the security patroller so that the principal Maria Mthimkhulu could be harmed because she was allegedly stealing the school’s money. Steyn made closing arguments to the court in which she stated that there were no reasons for the children to lie about what Molefe had allegedly done to them.
