The two men are Mongezi Mcunukelwa and Sbonelo Nkosingiphe Thwala. Mcunukelwa is an alleged serial killer accused in connection with two murder cases and one attempted murder. He abandoned his bail application at the Palm Ridge Magistrate’s Court on Tuesday – the day before his escape. Fellow escapee, 25-year-old Thwala, appeared in court for a murder committed in Jeppe in April, as well as the alleged possession of an unlawful firearm and ammunition. Both men will now face an additional charge of escaping from lawful custody.
