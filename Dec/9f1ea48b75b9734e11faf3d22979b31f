Makinana, who is an Agri SA board member and an Eastern Cape farmer, said research should have been done previously in order to start the process. “Research should have been done, starting from the time of Minister Hanekom whilst he was the minister of land reform. He gave a number of black people farms, and what has happened to those farms now, all of them, nothing takes place there in most of them,” Makinana said. Makinana was speaking at an Agri SA briefing in Centurion on Wednesday, where the association said that it would continue to pursue all credible avenues to protect farmers, and vowed to challenge the amendment to Section 25 of the Constitution in court.
