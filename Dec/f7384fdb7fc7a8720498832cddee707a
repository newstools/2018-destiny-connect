Police spokesperson Motlafela Mojapelo said on Saturday that no stone will be left unturned to ensure a safe festive season for people in the province. “This area in the Musina policing area constitutes about 90% of crimes our members respond to, hence we have placed roadblocks here today [Saturday].” Undocumented foreign nationals were arrested between Musina and the Beitbridge border post in Limpopo. Stop and search operations were conducted, led by the provincial police commissioner Lieutenant General Nneke Ledwaba.
