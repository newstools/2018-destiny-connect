Eskom said that load shedding was terminated at around 9pm on Monday. “However, the probability of Stage 2 rotational load shedding remains high from 9am until 10pm [on Tuesday] tomorrow as a result of a shortage of capacity due to a number of generating units still out of service due to breakdowns. Our maintenance teams continue to work through the night to bring back units,” the power utility said.
