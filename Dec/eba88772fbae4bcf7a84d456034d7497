Briefing Parliament’s portfolio committee on public enterprises, Denel board audit committee chair Talib Sadik said an investigation into the awarding of the bursary made several findings. The findings included that the school where Mahumapelo was studying to be a pilot was not an institution approved by Denel, that the pilot bursaries were not advertised in terms of Denel’s bursary policy, and that the bursary was granted without following the proper selection process. “As a result of that we have terminated the bursary policy,” said Sadik
