Speaking in Cape Town on Thursday, Cele announced the promotions, which include 30 000 junior-level positions, such as those carrying the rank of constable, sergeant and warrant officer. “In May this year, during the tabling of the 2018/2019 budget vote, we committed towards the following human resource priorities and highlighted that there was a backlog in [the] promotion and grade progression of employees between Levels 5 and 7,” Cele said. “About 69 219 members within these grades are long overdue for progression considerations. Therefore, we are pleased to announce the grade progression of members in the service.”
