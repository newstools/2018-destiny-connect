Festival goers have told of brazen robberies, traffic chaos and a lack of public transport outside the stadium. On social media, people detailed how the precinct became a “war zone” as running battles ensued between criminals and showgoers, with many being mugged of their cellphones and other belongings while young women waiting for their rides home at a nearby garage were harassed and nearly raped, with allegedly no security or police in sight. There were reports of a group of about 30 men using knives and guns to attack people and grab their belongings. The injuries included stab wounds and a broken nose. Speaking on Radio702 on Monday morning, Chief Executive of stadium management Jacques Grobbelaar said that their role was restricted to providing certain services and that the ultimate responsibility for safety and security in and around the stadium lay with the SA Police Service (Saps) and the Johannesburg Metro Police Department (JMPD).
