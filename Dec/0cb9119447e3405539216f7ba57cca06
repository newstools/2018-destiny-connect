Paul Shabangu, 42, from Nelspruit was the first person to be lifted in his wheelchair into the car, and he described the experience as life-changing. “I don’t stay far from the Kruger National Park, but then every time I thought about coming I would be discouraged knowing that it’s hard for me to get on the vehicles. But now I will as they have cars available for people with mobility disabilities,” he said.
