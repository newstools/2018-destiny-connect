Veteran journalist Thandeka Gqubule, one of the “SABC 8” and Professor Anton Harber have taken the matter to the South Gauteng High Court in Johannesburg. On 4 April 2018, HuffPost SA posted a video clip of an interview conducted with Winnie Madikizela-Mandela in June 2017. The interview was arranged after the screening of the documentary Winnie. In the video clip, Madikizela-Mandela referred to Gqubule, Harber and Nomavenda Mathiane. She said Gqubule was negatively disposed toward her and that the Weekly Mail, which Harber founded and edited in the 1980s, was “anti-me and anti-ANC”. She then claimed that the Weekly Mail “actually did the job for Stratcom”. The EFF published a statement on 12 April, condemning the SA National Editors’ Forum’s (Sanef) silence, saying journalists who served on apartheid’s Stratcom still reported in different newsrooms.
