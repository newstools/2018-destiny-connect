It emerged that several North West municipalities including, Madibeng, Moretele, Mahikeng and Dr Ruth Segomotsi Mompati invested R314 million in the defunct bank. The PTT’s spokesperson Kabelo Mataboge confirmed to News24 that a decision to recall all six mayors was taken during a meeting held on Monday, with two other mayors from Mauassie-Hills and Mamusa being axed over “governance issues”. The four municipalities were implicated in a damning report by Advocate Terry Motau titled the “Great Bank Heist” that found that over 50 individuals and companies looted almost R2 billion from the VBS bank. “We caution with the utmost restraint the municipalities that participated in this scam to the detriment of service delivery to our people,” said the PTT’s provincial co-ordinator Keneetswe Mosenogi in a statement. “There must be criminal charges preferred against those involved in this act,” continued Mosenogi.
