The SARC said that South Africa holds a competitive advantage in a number of fruit and beverage sectors, including Rooibos which, if fully exploited, could place the country amid the top export producers of high-value agricultural products. About half, or rather 6 000 and 7 000 tons of Rooibos is consumed locally annually, while the balance is exported to more than 30 countries, including Germany, the Netherlands, Japan, the UK and US. Nicie Vorster, spokesperson for the SARC, said the world is increasingly counting on agriculture to produce more nutritious food, and Rooibos fits the mould.
