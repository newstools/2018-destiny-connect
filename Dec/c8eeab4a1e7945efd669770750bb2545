“We have not accounted for the damage yet, but we can confirm that a number of stores were extensively damaged and numerous products were stolen too,” said a Vodacom spokesperson. “Vodacom stores are owned by franchisees and they have individually laid charges at the SAPS (South African Police Service). We condemn any violent behaviour and will continue to do so. Rest assured, we remain fully committed to cooperating with investigations led by government law enforcement agencies.” In two days of violence, Vodacom stores in at least three provinces were trashed and looted after the party took offence a speech made at the company’s Midrand, Johannesburg headquarters last Friday night by Corruption Watch Chairperson Mavuso Msimang. He was the guest speaker at the annual Vodacom Journalist of the Year awards. The company is a long-time sponsor of the country’s most prestigious set of awards that are national and cross-platform.
