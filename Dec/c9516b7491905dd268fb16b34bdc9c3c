Eighteen of the 20 pit toilets for the 202 pupils are broken. Ten of these are just holes in the ground. The staff have two toilets – one for men and one for women. One is broken and the seat can be moved. Teachers say students often take their toilet seat and put it on the holes. They say female teachers have to hunt for the toilet seat before they use the toilet. The school in Gatyane Mndundu village, near Butterworth, was built in 1985. School Principal Vuyani Bikitsha said two of the 10 prefab classrooms were destroyed by wind eight years ago and have not been replaced. None of the classrooms have window panes, some have broken doors, and the roofs leak. When it’s windy or raining, pupils take blankets to school to protect them from the elements. Bikitsha said that since the school has only six teachers, Grades 4 and 5 share a classroom and a teacher, as do Grades 7 and 8. Bikitsha said when he arrived in Mndundu in 1992, the condition of the school was not good, but it was better than it is now. He said repeated approaches to the Eastern Cape Department of Education (ECDoE) to fix the school buildings have been unsuccessful. “We sent so many letters to the department asking them to build us a new school with no luck,” said Bikitsha. Last month, parents sent a delegation to the ECDoE offices in Bhisho to demand answers.
