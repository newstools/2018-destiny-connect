Following a News24 investigation earlier last month, it was revealed that William Mahlatse Ramatseba, an office administrator working at Unisa’s Sunnyside campus, was the creator of Mzansistories.com and Allnews.co.za, two websites known for publishing false, defamatory and insensitive articles. At the time, Unisa indicated that they were conducting an investigation into Ramatseba’s conduct. Now, more than a month after the exposé, Unisa has yet to confirm the outcome of any of its investigations, or steps taken against Ramatseba. Despite requests for an update into the investigation made late in November, Unisa has not confirmed whether the investigation has been concluded, or whether any action has been taken in respect of the investigation’s findings. Last month, university spokesperson Martin Ramotshela told News24 that a preliminary investigation was underway. “We confirm that the university has initiated an investigation into the alleged conduct by the employee. Unisa views this alleged transgression in a very serious light and will take appropriate steps if the outcome of the investigation requires such.” At the time, Unisa said it noted the media report on Ramatseba’s conduct, but still had to comply with its own internal labour processes and had to investigate the matter before taking action. Possible criminal charges Ramatseba was linked to a network of 14 websites, and was identified using digital fingerprints scattered across websites, social media accounts and even the very adverts he used to make money.
