According to police, the two men, aged 34 and 41, were gunned down in Phillipi, Cape Town shortly after dropping off a pupil at the dance, which took place at Barron’s Estate. “It is alleged that the deceased came to the event to drop an unknown learner. As they left the venue they were shot at by an unknown male who fired several shots at the deceased’s vehicle. The two males died on the scene,” said police spokesperson Captain FC van Wyk. “Detectives are investigating all possibilities. Currently the motive is the subject of the police investigation.” Video footage circulating on social media shows one of the men slumped in the driver’s seat and bullet holes through vehicle’s side window.
