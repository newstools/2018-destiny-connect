Mayor Herman Mashaba said the suspect was arrested on Monday for allegedly soliciting a R70 000 bribe from a resident who owed the city R500 000. ”The police are looking for his accomplice who is also a city employee. It is alleged that the suspects approached the resident whose account is in arrears and told him that they would write off his R550 000 debt provided that he pays them R70 000,” said Mashaba. ”His debt was then reduced to R67 000, he paid them R30 000. But then he was not happy and demanded that his balance on the account should be zero and then he would pay them the balance of R40 000.”
