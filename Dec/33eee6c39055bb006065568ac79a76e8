“I have personally laid a complaint with the Public Protector of this country asking that the witness protection programme be thoroughly investigated and changed because in my own experience, I have realised that the system does not work for victims, especially young victims,” Zondi said. “When a young person helps clean up a country by getting rapists off the streets, it is then the responsibility of the state to protect that person and protect that person’s rights. “It is neither just, nor is it constitutional to ask a youth to drop out of school … go somewhere far away and forget their identity all to make cleaning up the country more convenient for the state. “Dropping off the face of the earth and cutting off all communication with family members sounds to me like a punishment that a criminal informant maybe would have no other option but to accept in order to avoid imprisonment. These are some of the changes that we are trying to pioneer.” Zondi, the first witness in the trial of Nigerian televangelist Timothy Omotoso, made her comments during the announcement of the establishment of her foundation to support women and children survivors of sexually, mentally, emotionally and spiritually abuse perpetrated in “sacred spaces”.
