Malema faces two charges for the contravention of Section 18(2)(b) of the Riotous Assemblies Act. The summons alleges that on 16 December, 2014, during the partyâ€™s elective conference, Malema incited party members to commit a crime, by occupying any vacant land they came across. A second summons indicated that he has been charged a second time for a similar transgression for making the same call in Newcastle on 26 June, 2016. It was widely reported in 2014 that AfriForum had laid charges against Malema for the land invasion speech at UFS.
