An online recruitment system for government jobs to simplify application processes, especially for young people, will be launched on Wednesday, the Department of Public Service and Administration said. ”As part of the strategy to introduce a paperless administration across the public service, Minister Ayanda Dlodlo instructed the department … to introduce a digital Z83 application form as an additional platform for job seekers in the public service,” the department said, adding that applications would still be accepted through physical forms for those without internet access.
