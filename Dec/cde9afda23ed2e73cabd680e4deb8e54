The report was the subject of a court case in Cape Town last week in which Afriforum had unsuccessfully sought an interdict against the process unfolding after the Constitutional Review Committee (CRC) had adopted the report. The committee was established after the Economic Freedom Fighters introduced a motion in favour of amending the Constitution in February this year. The motion was supported by the ANC, which adopted a resolution in favour of land expropriation without compensation at the December elective conference. The National Freedom Party and the United Democratic Movement also supported the motion, as well as the report adopted by the CRC. According to News24,Â The ANC, EFF, NFP and UDM support the adoption of the report, while the DA, IFP, FF Plus, Cope and ACDP are opposing it. The parties opposing an amendment are likely to raise the matter of the process the committee followed in dealing with the hundreds of thousands of written submissions it received. But it is highly likely that the report will be adopted.
