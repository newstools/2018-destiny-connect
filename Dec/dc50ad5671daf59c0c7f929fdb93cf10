On its Twitter account, One On Nicol Drive-Thru Bar announced that it would be opening its doors to the public on Wednesday. “Tokyo has a beer vending machine, the Aussies have drive-thru bottle stores, and now Jozi has its own drive-thru bar!” it boasts on Facebook. In a video on its social media platforms, Jason le Grange, said to be the pop-up bar’s owner, explains that he came upon the idea in Tokyo, Japan, where he saw a vending machine dispensing alcoholic drinks. “So I thought, why couldn’t this idea work back home? And, uh, here we are,” Le Grange says, pointing to the completed bar. In terms of the theme, Le Grange explains that it was decided to go with an “island vibe”. “You know, as people come over this little crest they’re going to see this awesome setup here with our palm trees and our decking and the chairs and tables… “Pull in, grab a drink and off you go,” Le Grange says. Le Grange said if people wanted to sit down, they would be served two, three, “maybe four max…and off you go.” The address of the pop-up bar listed on the Facebook page is the same as a power substation, with a huge billboard across the way.
