Mashaba said two properties were targeted including 18 Gary Avenue, where 11 undocumented people were arrested and that 21 were arrested at 122 Kelvin Drive. He said the suspects are expected to appear in court on Wednesday after immigration officers from the Department of Home Affairs had processed them to ascertain relevant information. The arrests were made during an operation led by the City’s group forensic and investigation services unit in conjunction with the South African Police Service, Johannesburg Metropolitan Police Department, Department of Home Affairs and the local residents association. “It is essential that we bring back the rule of law in our City and take it back from the criminal elements such as landlords who take advantage of desperate people and house them under deplorable conditions. “About 832 properties are confirmed to be hijacked in Johannesburg; 34 properties that were previously in the hands of hijackers have been handed back to the rightful owners. The Residents’ Association has undertaken to provide security to both properties. I want to see rundown buildings turned into quality, low-cost housing for our residents and affordable rental spaces for small businesses.”
