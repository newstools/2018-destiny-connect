Speaking at the launch of the Cheryl Zondi Foundation on Tuesday, Zondi said it was time to stand up for victims of abuse who have been violated in what she described as “sacred places” like churches. Zondi, who was the first witness to testify in the trial of Nigerian televangelist Timothy Omotoso, said her foundation was geared towards providing support to women and children who have been sexually, mentally, emotionally and spiritually abused in sacred spaces, and also raise awareness of the need for psychological support in such cases. “The tagline for the Cheryl Zondi Foundation is ‘Turning Pain Into Purpose’. I have named the foundation after myself because of the level of support I received after I came out about my ordeal, and I aim to inspire other victims,” Zondi said.
