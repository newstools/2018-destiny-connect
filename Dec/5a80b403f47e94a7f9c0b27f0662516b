According to Sasol, the company was “shocked and appalled at the traumatic situation that unfolded at our Sasol Ormonde View franchise retail site” in the early hours of Monday morning. “Concertgoers leaving the FNB Stadium after an event convened at the Ormonde View site where several people fell victim to opportunistic preying by perpetrators. We deeply regret the ordeal that the concertgoers experienced at the retail site, which was occupied by extraordinarily large numbers of people,” Sasol said in a statement. On Monday, News24 reported that people leaving the Global Citizen Festival: Mandela 100 event were attacked by gangs of juveniles and stabbed and robbed of cellphones and handbags, according to countless social media posts. Witnesses said the attacks happened in the vicinity of the Sasol garage situated close to the FNB Stadium.
