Power utility Eskom warned on Monday that it was likely to effect more of the planned rolling power blackouts it implemented over the past week to ease pressure on the national grid. “With a number of power-generating units still out of service due to breakdowns, the prognosis for today is that Eskom will be forced to implement stage 2 load-shedding from 9am to 10pm again,” Eskom spokesman Khulu Phasiwe said via his Twitter account.
