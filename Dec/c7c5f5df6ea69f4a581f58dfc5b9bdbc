According to witnesses, the attacks happened in the vicinity of the Sasol garage situated close to the FNB Stadium in Soweto, in the early hours of Monday morning. Catherine Constantinides, Director of Miss Earth SA, tweeted that the experience was “horrifying”. “There was NO SAPS present. Nothing. The screaming of girls and people everywhere still rings in my head. People running away holding bricks because they feared for their safety. They knifed people, burning people. It was horrifying,” Constantinides tweeted. “I’m deeply pained by the trauma [and] reality of what we went through last night. It was more than mugging [and] taking phones. You prayed with your life not to be stabbed/punched or brutally attacked, all of which I witnessed.”
