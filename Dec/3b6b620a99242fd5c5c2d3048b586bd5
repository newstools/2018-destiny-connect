Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi has warned that if land expropriation without compensation is not done within the limits of the law it would open up South Africa’s old wounds and work against social cohesion and future investment. “I’m deeply concerned by where the expropriation of land without compensation will lead us. I’m not against it, but if we do not handle it with great care it is certain to deter foreign investment,” he said at the Kingsmead stadium in Durban, KwaZulu-Natal on Saturday. He also said that, if he were an investor, he would have to think twice about investing in a country with land uncertainty, the SABC reported. “If I put myself in the feet of an investor in Europe or America, and I’m asked to go to a country where there’s expropriation without compensation… unless I need my head read, I would not go there. Buthelezi was also of the view that expropriation without compensation would turn away international investors.
