These were the words of Limpopo Premier and ANC Provincial Chairperson Stan Mathabatha on Sunday as he paid tribute to slain councillor Thabang Maupa, who was killed by unknown gunmen on 28 November. Maupa, a councillor in the Fetakgomo-Tubatse local municipality, was known for being a staunch critic of those who had links to, or illegally deposited money into the now liquidated VBS Mutual Bank.
