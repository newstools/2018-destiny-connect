Omotoso and his two co-accused Lusanda Sulani and Zukiswa Sitho made a brief appearance in the Port Elizabeth High Court. The case has been postponed to 4 February, 2019. “All the papers are in order and before the Supreme Court of Appeal. We are simply awaiting the decision of the judges of that court at this stage,” defence advocate Peter Daubermann told the court before proposing the postponement. Makuala in October previously rejected the defence’s two applications for leave to appeal his ruling that he won’t recuse himself, citing that there were “no reasonable prospects of success”.
