Mukwege and Nadia Murad, a survivor of Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant’s sexual slavery, said at an emotional ceremony in Norway’s capital Oslo that the international community had to do more to protect women and children in conflict. “If there is a war to be waged, it is the war against the indifference which is eating away at our societies,” said Mukwege, whose Panzi hospital in the Democratic Republic of Congo’s war-torn east has treated the wounds of tens of thousands of sexual violence victims. He said the trade in the country’s abundant natural resources helped fuel the violence. “We love nice cars, jewellery and gadgets. I have a smartphone myself. These items contain minerals found in our country. Often mined in inhumane conditions by young children, victims of intimidation and sexual violence,” Mukwege said.
