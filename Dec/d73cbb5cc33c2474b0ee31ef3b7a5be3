In a statement, DA national spokesperson Solly Malatsi said the party’s North West leader, Joe McGluwa, will also lay charges against Mngxitima for incitement of violence. “We cannot allow Mngxitama’s comments and actions to go unchallenged,” Malatsi said. “Institutions of the state empowered to investigate and prosecute on matters of this nature have a duty to act.” During his speech in Potchefstroom over the weekend, Mngxitama reportedly urged an audience to kill five white people for every one black person that dies because of taxi violence. Malatsi said Mngxitama’s behaviour was “undoubtedly a trend characteristic of the BLF, as is clearly evident based on their track record over the past two years”.
