Cardi B, real name Belcalis Marlenis Almánzar, announced today that she and husband Kiari Kendrell Cephus also known as Offset have broken up. It is unclear what prompted the rapper to disclose the status of their marriage, but she took to her Instagram account to get it off her chest. Indicating that trouble has been brewing in paradise for a while, the Bodak Yellow hitmaker said in her announcement that she’d been trying to work it out with the father of her daughter for a while. “So everybody been bugging me and everything and you know, I’ve been trying to work things out with my baby-father for a hot minute now,” she said. “And we’re really good friends and you know we’re really good business partners, and you know he’s always someone that I run to to talk to and we got a lot of love for each other. But things just haven’t been working out between us for a long for a long time. It’s nobody’s fault… I guess we just grew out of love,” her post read. She closed off by confirming that they were no longer a couple and that it might take time to get a divorce. “I’m going to always have a lot of love for him because he is my daughter’s father,” she said.
