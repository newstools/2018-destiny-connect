“The final decision will of course be made once we know that you have passed your National Senior Certificate, that you are admitted to an approved programme, and that you are registered,” Pandor said at a briefing in Cape Town. NSFAS will finalise the approved students by the end of January, who will get a split of its R32bn budget. In 2018, NSFAS disbursed loans and bursaries worth around R22bn for around 659 000 applicants, as former president Jacob Zuma’s promise of free higher education was phased in for those who qualify. The budget is expected to increase next year to R32bn to fund about 400 920 TVET students and 377 050 university students. After a fraught year, in which the scheme was placed under administration, the scheme and the department are feeling optimistic that 2019 will be better.
