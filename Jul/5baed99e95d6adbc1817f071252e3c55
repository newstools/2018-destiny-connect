The National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) will not be opening its application process for funding for the 2019 academic year as expected on Wednesday The move follows a directive issued by Higher Education Minister Naledi Pandor in a bid to get the student financier’s house in order after discovering a serious backlog in paying out scheme beneficiaries, some of whom have not received funding for 2017 and 2018. NSFAS has blamed the delay on former President Jacob Zuma’s 11th hour shock announcement in December last year declaring that fully subsidised free education for poor students would be implemented in January this year.

City Press reported on Sunday that Pandor had written to the NSFAS board, chaired by Sizwe Nxasana, earlier this month, informing it of her decision to temporarily suspend the application for the new year, while also revealing that her department would institute an investigation into the funding scheme’s processes in August. Zwane said funding decisions for the 2018 academic year had been finalised, with funding approved for over 400 000 students and 365 000 students having received allowances this year to date. Meanwhile, the National Education, Health and Allied Worker’s Union (Nehawu) have called for a motion of no confidence in Zwane, who it accuses of making irregular management appointments that included Zwane bringing on two people to serve in a post that only required the employment of one person. The senior managers he allegedly hired were former subordinates he worked with previously at Absa, the newspaper reports.

New dates for when the application process for 2019 funding opens will be communicated in due course, but in the meantime, NSFAS is urging students who haven’t signed their 2018 NSFAS bursary agreements to do so and submit it by Tuesday’s (31 July) deadline, as failing to do so will result in the student not receiving an allowance.
