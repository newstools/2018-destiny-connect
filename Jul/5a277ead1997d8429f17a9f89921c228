Robben Island management has slammed reports that former President Nelson Mandela's cell will be auctioned at this year's CEO SleepOut, which is expected to be held at the prison This comes after a poster did the rounds on social media, bearing the words: “Robben Island room bid. In addition, the once in-a-lifetime opportunity to sleep in Madiba’s personal cell number – seven will be auctioned off for the night with bids opening at $250 000 (R3,4 million).” It sparked a lot of debate and some said the sleepout was done in bad taste.

We’ve got so many bodies that we are accountable to and it belongs to the nation. So, what right would we have to auction Mandela’s cell – or any cell for that matter.” The sleepout was supposed to be held on 18 July. However, Ranaboa said the organisers had pulled out and asked for a postponement. It would have marked the day that Mandela turned 100. According to Ranaboa, the organisers asked for a postponement to November.
