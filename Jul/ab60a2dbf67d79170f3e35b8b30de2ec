Zimbabwe votes on Monday in an election that could, if deemed credible tilt the country toward recovery after years of economic collapse and repression under former leader Robert Mugabe If it is flawed and disputed, as some predict, the southern African nation could slide deeper into upheaval, AP reported. The contest pits President Emmerson Mnangagwa, Mugabe’s successor and former enforcer, who now says he represents change, against Nelson Chamisa, the 40-year-old leader of an opposition targeted by violence and intimidation in the past. Just more than 1 000 polling booths opened today around Zimbabwe, where voting for a new President began at 7am. Voting appears to have got off to a smooth start, with some 71 000 policemen deployed to polling stations. International observers have also fanned out across the country to witness Zimbabwe’s historic elections in which long-time ruler Robert Mugabe (94) is not on the ballot, which has 23 hopefuls.

On Sunday, Mugabe irked Mnangagwa with his comments suggesting the present regime was illegal and voting for Chamisa would return Zimbabwe to constitutionality. The 94-year-old deposed President said he would not vote for his Zanu-PF party, which is now led by Mnangagwa. The polls close at 7pm. – African News Agency
