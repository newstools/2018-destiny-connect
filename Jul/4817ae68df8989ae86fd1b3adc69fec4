The fight for the late Nelson Mandela's home in Qunu has intensified, as Zenani and Zindzi Mandela enter the fray The application might have failed in two lower courts, but Zenani and Zindzi Mandela, the daughters of Madiba and the late Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, believe their Constitutional Court challenge of their father’s will – in so far as the Qunu house is concerned – will be upheld. As executors of their mother’s estate, the sisters are picking off where Mam’ Winnie left off, with an application for leave to appeal a Mthatha High Court ruling that rejected Madikizela-Mandela’s claim on the house, a ruling that was last year upheld by the Supreme Court of Appeal. They are ultimately hoping for a precedent-setting outcome that will protect the rights of women married under customary law.

The Royal House of Mandela previously rejected Madikizela-Mandela’s claim to the property, saying Madiba’s final wishes, that the Qunu residence be managed by the executors of his estate, should be honoured.
