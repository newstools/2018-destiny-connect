Hollywood A-lister Anthony Anderson has come out strongly to deny allegations of assault levelled against him The woman claims she met Anderson at an event he hosted and that she had catered for, last year. The pair allegedly met up on a different occasion to discuss future business opportunities and this is when the alleged assault took place, according to The Blast. Anderson, however, has rubbished the claims, choosing instead to lament the ease at which a person can report false information. “It is unfortunate that anyone can file a police report, whether it is true or false,” Anderson’s representative Cindy Guagenti said in a statement. “The authorities have not contacted Anthony or any of his representatives about this matter. Anthony unequivocally disputes the claim.” READ MORE: Emmy Awards 2018 features highest number of black nominees ever While details surrounding the assault remain unclear, it’s not the first time the actor has been embroiled in assault allegations levelled by women. In 2004, Anderson and assistant director Wayne Witherspoon were accused of raping a 25-year-old woman who worked as an extra on the film Hustle and Flow over a decade ago. The charges were dismissed, with Judge Anthony Johnson commenting: “This is absolutely the most suspicious case I’ve ever heard.” The LA Police Department has confirmed that an active investigation against Anderson is underway. The allegations come less than two weeks after Anderson was nominated for an Emmy Award for his role as Dre Johnson on the hit series Black-ish.
