The National Union of Mineworkers' (NUM) regional Secretary Phillip Mankge confirmed that six miners were killed in mine fires on Sunday The deaths come after a fire broke out at the mine in the early hours of Sunday. The fire reportedly started at conveyor belt five, and when smoke was seen by a logistic belt operator, the workers were instructed to evacuate the area to the closest refuge chamber, the union said on Sunday. NUM said it would, together with Cosatu’s Secretary in Limpopo, Gerald Thwala, meet to establish the root cause of the incident. “As the NUM, we vehemently condemn this kind of incident, as there is a high number of fatalities in the mining industry in South Africa this year,” the union said in a statement. The union has urged the Department of Mineral Resources to play a role in ensuring that mines are safe and to make the safety of the mineworkers a priority.
