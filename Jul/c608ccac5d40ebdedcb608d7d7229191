Prince Harry and his wife Meghan have visited an exhibition in London charting the life of Nelson Mandela, AP reported Peter Hain, a former anti-apartheid campaigner and Chair of the Nelson Mandela Centenary Exhibition, said it was “very fitting” for the royal couple to visit because Harry does charitable work in Southern Africa, and Meghan has said that Mandela is one of her heroes. The exhibition has been shown in various forms around the world, including six weeks at the Paris Town Hall in 2013.
