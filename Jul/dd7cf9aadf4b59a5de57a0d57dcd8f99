Emmy Awards 2018 has smashed records by nominating the highest number of black actors and actresses in the awards' history The face of TV in the USA is changing and is evident from this year’s newly released list of Emmy Award nominees. For the first time in the TV awards show’s 70-year history, over 30 actors and actresses of colour were nominated for awards across various categories. Last year’s big winner Donald Glover, who won awards for Best Actor and Best Director in a Comedy Series, has once again cracked the nod for his leading role in Atlanta, receiving a nomination for Best Actor in a Comedy Series, as well as nominations for acting, writing, and directing the acclaimed series, which has been nominated for a total of 16 awards.

Crooner John Legend is up against Antonio Banderas and Benedict Cumberbatch for Best Lead Actor in a Limited Series or Movie and if he snatches the gong, he will join Whoopi Goldberg as the only other black person to have been awarded what is considered to be the Holy Grail of the entertainment industry – Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony awards.
