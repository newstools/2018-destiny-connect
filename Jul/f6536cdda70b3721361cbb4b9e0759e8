Sibongile Mani made another brief appearance in the East London Magistrate's Court on Monday It’s bound to be an anxious wait for the 28-year-old accounting student and branch secretary of the Pan Africanist Student Movement of Azania, whose case was on Monday postponed to 24 July. She is facing a charge of theft after going on a mammoth spending spree when a whopping R14,1 million was transferred into her bank account erroneously by the National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) last year. She was supposed to have received just R1400.

If media reports are anything to go by, Mani lived her best life for three months, allegedly throwing wild parties for friends at which expensive bottles of vodka were served – apparently worth R700 a pop. She also splurged on expensive Peruvian hair extensions, designer clothes and an iPhone 7. According to the state, Mani received the money from NSFAS in June, with the error only detected at the end of August.
