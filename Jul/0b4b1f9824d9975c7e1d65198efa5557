Award-winning South African author Zakes Mda has announced that he will not be using any music from DJ Black Coffee for his upcoming movie because the sought-after music-maker had performed in Israel “There are some great Black Coffee sounds that would be ideal for one of the films I’m involved in making. But now, damn, there’s this Israel thing!” Mda tweeted. Top local entertainer Black Coffee was subject to widespread criticism after he played a show in April in Tel Aviv. Afro-Palestine Newswire Service reports that the entertainer performed just as Israeli army snipers killed dozens of unarmed Palestinian protesters in the Gaza Strip during the Great Return March. Soon after the controversial show, the ANC called for a cultural boycott of Israel.

Black Coffee, who is on record as saying he “loved” Tel Aviv and that his gig was sold out, has not responded. – African News Agency
