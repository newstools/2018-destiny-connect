Eskom has issued a warning of a risk of load shedding, as ongoing industrial action continues to disrupt operations at the utility's power plants and stations “There’s a high risk of load shedding this evening, as Eskom is currently experiencing a sharp increase in unplanned outages. Customers are urged to switch off all non-essential appliances in an effort to reduce pressure on the power grid,” Eskom spokesperson Khulu Phasiwe said.
