Mayor Herman Mashaba on Wednesday made the shocking revelation that one of the suspects arrested in connection with a cash-in-transit heist works at Luthuli House, the headquarters of the ANC “Yesterday, I was informed of the arrest of four cash-in-transit heist suspects, among them an individual believed to be an employee at Luthuli House, the national headquarters of the governing ANC,” Mashaba said in a statement. “The suspects were allegedly involved in a cash-in-transit heist in Dobsonville, Soweto, which led to a manhunt. Some of the suspects were arrested on 6 July, while the remainder were apprehended in the early hours of 7 July.” Mashaba said the raid was conducted by a joint operation of the Johannesburg Metro Police Department’s K9 Narcotics Unit and the SA Police Service. He said four hijacked vehicles were recovered, two of which were used in the robbery. “The arrest of this individual does bring into question whether the ANC has been aware of the arrest of this individual and, if so, why they have remained silent on such an important matter,” said the Mayor, who is a member of the DA.
