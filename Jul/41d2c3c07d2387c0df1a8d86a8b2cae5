South Africa's central bank said it had secured a guarantee from the National Treasury for retail depositors with failed for VBS Mutual Bank for up to R100 000 per depositor The South African Reserve Bank (SARB) said it would announce the details on the repayment of retail deposits on 9 July. Retail depositors refer to individuals, funeral schemes, burial societies, savings clubs and stokvels. The SARB placed VBS under curatorship in March and its annual financial statements were found to be inaccurate.

It said at the time all retail deposits up to the amount of R50 000 per depositor would be guaranteed.
