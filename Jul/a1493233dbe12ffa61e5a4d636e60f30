Joining the global “silent airport” trend that has seen airports across the world reduce their noise footprint by limiting boarding announcements, King Shaka International Airport no longer makes calls for passengers at domestic check-in and boarding gate areas “The objective is not only to minimise background noise, but also the sense of hurry at the terminal by reducing the number of announcements,” says King Shaka International Airport spokesman Colin Naidoo, as reported by TimesLive. “Passengers should check their boarding passes and the flight information displays for boarding times‚ gates and any other changes.” READ MORE: CT airport must be renamed after Chris Hani – SACP Airports Company South Africa (Acsa) shared the announcement on Twitter: “No passenger boarding calls will be made at King Shaka International Airport from 1 July 2018.
