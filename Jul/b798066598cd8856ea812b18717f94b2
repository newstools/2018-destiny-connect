eNCA anchor Cathy Mohlahlana is set to climb to the top of Kilimanjaro, the highest mountain in Africa Mohlahlana, co-anchor on eNCA’s NewsNight, is one of a group of people who will join the Trek for Mandela initiative this year. Two groups will embark on the trek, with Mohlahlana being part of the second party who are looking to reach the summit in early August. Speaking to former eNCA anchor Joanne Joseph on 702 during an interview on Wednesday, Mohlahlana said: “It’s such an emotional journey, as well as a physical one, because there’s obviously getting ready physically, which includes lots and lots of walking and climbing stairs and just getting some strength in your legs that will carry you through the journey. But the most challenging part is the mental issue.” Mohlahlana said she’s already had quite a few sessions with one of the team leaders of the mountain trek about getting into the right headspace. “We’re expecting snow, it’s going to be below freezing point. I can barely handle Johannesburg’s cold. I can’t imagine what it’s going to be like to walk out, over snow, in the night in the dark, but I think that I’m ready as everybody else who has decided to take on this journey because we understand the cause,” she said.

It’s nerve-racking,” she added. Mohlahlana’s tweet ahead of her departure:  – News24
