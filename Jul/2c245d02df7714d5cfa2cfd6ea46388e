Beloved radio personality Xolani Gwala is officially in remission 702 Station Manager Thabisile Mbete said the station remained optimistic that the legendary broadcaster will stage a comeback in due course, now that his colon cancer has gone into remission. “Xolani is in remission and is back at home recovering from his last operation. We are all looking forward to having him back on the station once he has recovered,” Mbete was quoted saying in a TimesLive report. Gwala announced his colon cancer diagnosis in September last year, after listeners started raising questions about his whereabouts after being off-air for weeks.

He had another operation this year and had been receiving chemotherapy treatment since last year. At the time, he acknowledged that he faced a mammoth battle ahead of him. “It is going to be a very long fight, partly because it was advanced – a difficult fight, but a fight I am ready for,” he said. Family has been central to Gwala’s recovery. He told Drum last year about the instrumental role his family were playing in keeping him positive and strong when bouts of fear would creep in. “Family is at the centre of this entire thing – it’s your family that makes you stay positive. I’m not ready to die yet,” Gwala said.

Three weeks ago, Gwala’s former colleague and close friend Redi Tlhabi shared an status update in a tweet, letting South Africans know that he was doing better than many expected. “Xolani is exceeding all expectations. My darling friend is still standing,” she said.
