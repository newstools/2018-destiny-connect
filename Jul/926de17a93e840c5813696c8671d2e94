South Africans in the Western, Eastern and Northern Cape are experiencing a winter wonderland If you haven’t already dug up your electric blanket and hot water bottles, tonight is the night to do so. Weather forecasters are warning of bitterly cold weather over the next two days, thanks to a massive cold front that is currently moving across the Western Cape, southern Northern Cape and the Eastern Cape. Heavy rainfall left parts of Cape Town flooded, with over 4 000 homes in informal settlements in Khayelitsha, Philippi and Macassar affected, but emergency services said no evacuations or emergency shelters were activated. Power lines were also down in Lansdowne, Gugulethu and Wynberg, while trees were uprooted in Constantia, Vredekloof, Durbanville, Tamboerskloof and Pinelands. The cold front is expected to spread over the southern Free State and into KwaZulu-Natal on Tuesday, bringing with it cold, wet and windy weather conditions. South Africans in the affected areas didn’t seem to be bothered by the bitter cold. Instead, many came out to take pictures, while children built snowmen.
