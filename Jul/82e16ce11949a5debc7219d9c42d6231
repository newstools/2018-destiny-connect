ANC Secretary-General Ace Magashule has lashed out at party members who continue to take the party to court "if a decision doesn't favour the individual" Earlier on Thursday, disgruntled ANC members went to the KwaZulu-Natal High Court in Pietermaritzburg to apply for an interdict to stop the eighth provincial elective conference from proceeding. However, the application was dismissed with costs. The conference was supposed to take place last month in Empangeni, but it was interdicted at the 11th hour. The ANC’s provincial executive committee was disbanded earlier this year, after the High Court in Pietermaritzburg ruled in September last year, that the results of the November 2015 elective conference were unlawful.

Who is giving you money? Who pays your senior counsel? Should we conclude it is those people who want to derail the organisation? The enemy of the revolution is among you,” he said. He asked members to “toe the line” when the highest structure of the ANC has spoken. He added that the ANC had exhausted all internal processes dealing with the disgruntled members. The National Dispute Resolution Committee (NDRC), led by Deputy Secretary-General Jessie Duarte, and the movement’s national executive committee, led by Nocawe Mafu, visited the province and dealt with appeals and grievances from the Lower South Coast, Moses Mabhida and Harry Gwala regions. “What else do you still want when we have exhausted all the internal processes of the ANC? If you are a member of the ANC, you must respect conference resolutions. The views of the majority must prevail over the views of the individuals,” Magashule said. He urged delegates to use the conference to “self-introspect and self-correct”. “We need to indeed tell no lies to each other or to our people. We must restore the party’s dignity. We need to understand where there’s a revolution, there’s always a counter-revolution.” Magashule suggested that some members inside the ANC were ill-disciplined. “They fail to take instructions from the ANC. The ANC is the centre of power, not you. It doesn’t matter if you’re a premier or councillor. We must work as a collective and share our wisdom. Those who lose positions in this conference have a duty to respect the outcomes of the conference and accept new leadership,” said Magashule.

He led our movement to achieve free education for all students of our country, especially those who are from the working class and poor families,” he said. Magashule said Zuma also introduced radical socio-economic transformation. — News24 Wire
