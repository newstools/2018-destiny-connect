Letshego Zulu is in Tanzania to once again pay tribute to her late husband Gugu, ahead of the second anniversary of his death Teaming up with The Kilimanjaro Project and with her mum and mother-in-law by her side, Letshego will be planting trees along the slopes of Mount Kilimanjaro tomorrow as a way of keeping the race-car driver’s legacy alive. “Trees are living legacies, unlike flowers that wilt and die and are thrown away. Trees that are nurtured and can grow to provide fruit, shade, water, nourishment to the communities in which the grow. Trees are a gift that keeps on giving and they are reminders of life,” Letshego said.

Zulu passed away while summiting Mount Kilimanjaro in 2016 on a Trek4Mandela expedition in aid of raising funds for sanitary pads for schoolgirls. Last year, the mum of one summited the mountain in honour of Zulu. This year, she says she’s come to grips with her loss and has emerged from a dark place into a lighter, celebratory phase.
