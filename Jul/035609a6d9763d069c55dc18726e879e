Yet another new video-on-demand (VOD) service plans to launch before the end of 2018 with Thabo Molefe, better known as Tbo Touch, planning to launch his THD service within months THD is set for launch in October – an expansion of Tbo Touch’s existing Touch HD online radio station – and will compete with rival services like Naspers’ Showmax , Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and DEOD in a field that has already seen VIDI, Altech Node, MTN’s VU and PCCW Global’s ONTAPtv.com bail out and shutter. In an interview with TechCentral, Tbo Touch said that he had secured millions of rand in seed investment from the Industrial Development Corporation (IDC). Pricing for THD will be released later, but the entrepreneur said his VOD service will offer video priced more aggressively than competitors and through apps and the Internet.
