Black said it was her first time performing at the festival, adding that she was surprised that she was asked to do another show as she sold out her initial booking. She received love from the crowd, with people singing along to her popular songs including the hit “Amazulu”. “Unfortunately I didn’t get to experience the whole of the festival, but the little experience that I had was out of this world, from the drama to the music show, people there ranged from adults to kids who were as incredible as I was delighted to entertain them,” said Black.
