Former President Thabo Mbeki believes Mandela's legacy posed a serious challenge to all South Africans Former President Thabo Mbeki said the legacy left by an anti-apartheid icon and former statesman Nelson Mandela posed a serious challenge to all South Africans to walk in his giant footsteps and try to realise his principles every day. “I think it poses a challenge to all of us as South Africans because everybody says we must honour the legacy and the slogan is to be the legacy of Nelson Mandela. Now we have the challenge to translate that into practical issue. We shouldn’t just make slogans. It’s a big challenge,” Mbeki said.

It’s relatively easy to say those things, but to achieve them, as I think all of us have seen over the past 24 years, is not easy.” Mbeki was speaking at the Nelson Mandela Foundation’s sod-turning event to turn Mandela’s home in Houghton, Johannesburg, into a world-class boutique hotel as part of his centenary celebrations.
