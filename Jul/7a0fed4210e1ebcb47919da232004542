[FEATURED] With the AccelerateHer programme, Shell helps women who are starting their own businesses While women have made strides in their careers and business, there’s still room for further growth. The support of women for their female peers has gained traction in recent years and this has encouraged many to take the plunge into entrepreneurship. “The way to achieve your own success is to be willing to help somebody else get it first,” says American speaker and author Iyanla Vanzant. Shell is in full support of this. Its AccelerateHer initiative is a good example, as it was pioneered by women, for women. Launched in 2016, this programme is aimed at assisting aspiring female entrepreneurs with skills to start and maintain their own businesses. Times have changed With many women sealing deals, signing cheques and leading respected boardrooms, Shell and its partners, Seed Academy and Women Development Bank Investment, were inspired to offer developmental workshops, business support sessions and mentorship from industry experts. Seed Academy’s 2017 entrepreneurial survey of over 1 200 entrepreneurs showed that the majority found value in participating in training programmes or incubators, and 78% had taken part in one. “Corporate enterprise and supplier development programmes featured too, with 14% of respondents having been part of these,” the survey reveals. Women for women “When women collaborate, my goodness, great and magical things happen,” says Basetsana Kumalo, CEO of Basetsana Women Investment Holdings. Since its launch, AccelerateHer has attracted huge interest from the market, with many of its participants going on to secure industry licences for their business operations and achieve great success.
