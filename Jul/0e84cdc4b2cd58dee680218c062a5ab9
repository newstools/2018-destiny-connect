These are the most affordable suburbs in Gauteng for first-time home-buyers right now According to the Lightstone Property Group, Protea Glen in Soweto is emerging as one of the most sought-after suburbs in Joburg for first-time home-buyers. Khosi Sibiya, a Protea Glen estate agent for Seeff, says the suburb’s close proximity to amenities and its affordability are the main drivers of the suburb’s popularity and rapid growth. “Protea Glen offers affordable and excellent value for money when compared to many other suburbs in the Johannesburg South region. Most properties here range between R450 000 and R800 000, but an apartment with two bedrooms, a full bathroom and an open plan lounge and kitchen can be picked up for as low as R290 000,” Sibiya says. Prospective-homebuyers can also pick up a two-bedroom townhouse from between R380 000 to R420 00, while a there-bedroom townhouse goes for between R450 000 to R480 000.

A hospital is also in the construction phase and the suburb has great infrastructure providing good and affordable public transport.” Weltevreden Park With entry-level prices starting at R500 000, Weltevreden Park is a great choice for first-time home-buyers because you’ll be able to take advantage of not paying transfer duty fees on property valued up to R900 000. “For R500 000-R600 000, the average apartment offers two bedrooms and a bathroom with an open-plan kitchen and lounge area with fairly modern finishes. Most apartments are multi-level with a carport. The average size ranges between 55m2 to 65m2,” says Seeff Randburg Residential Sales Director Eloisé de Stefanis. “From R600 000-R750 000, buyers may find a simplex unit with a garden and two bathrooms up to 87m2, but generally a garden simplex unit costs between R750 000 and R1 million.” Bryanston, Lonehill, Sunninghill, Paulshof Moving into these northern suburbs of Sandton, entry-level prices are significantly higher, and hover between R800 000 for a one-bedroom apartment in Lonehill and R1,2 million for an apartment in Bryanston.

Annual sales in these suburbs rake in well over R1 billion. “Bryanston is considered a central Sandton suburb and Lonehill is its northern neighbour, positioned just west of Fourways. Both suburbs are accessed from the William Nicol main route – an arterial route running from northern Fourways to the doorstep of Sandton City. This, of course, makes the suburbs popular for working professionals, often your first-time buyers,” says Seeff Sandton MD Charles Vining. He adds that first-time buyers can expect to pay up to R1,25 million for a two- or three-bedroom apartment in Paulshof, he adds. Equestria and Moreleta Park With a large sectional title market, these suburbs are in high demand from first-time home-buyers and are often considered good stepping-stone suburbs for home-owners who aspire to upgrade to more expensive properties.

Buyers are able to find units with two and three bedrooms in this price range,” says Gerhard van der Linde, Seeff Pretoria East MD. Centurion Steve van Wyk, Seeff’s MD in Centurion, says Die Hoewes is very popular and has around 6 300 sectional title units ranging in price from an affordable R545 000 to about R2,4 million, with an average price of R750 000. “Approximately 500 units are sold annually and 38% of the buyers are under the age of 35. The appeal for first-time buyers lies not only in the fact that Die Hoewes is affordable, but also that it offers lock-up-and-go units close to major highways, the Gautrain Station and all amenities in Centurion,” he says. Sunnyside This suburb is one of the fastest-growing in Pretoria and is easy on the pocket, with entry-level prices starting at around R270 000-R360 000 for one-bedroom and two-bedroom apartments respectively. You can pick up a three- to four-bedroom home in Clydesdale near Loftus Versveld for between R1,6 million and R2,8 million, says Seeeff Sunnyside agent Hayford Obeng.
