Kilimanjaro holds a special place in Forbes’ heart. She has said she has dreamed of climbing the mountain from the age of 11. As the place above the clouds, it’s a place she would escape to to avoid the trauma of surviving childhood sexual abuse. She said she was re-inspired to fulfil her dream three years ago, following the birth of her grandchild Kairo. She chose to tackle the climb this year as part of celebrations to commemorate her 50th birthday this month.
