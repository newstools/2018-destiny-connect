The Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) will deploy 71 000 officers for the country's general elections next Monday, while civil society coalition the Election Situation Room (ESR) has deployed 6 000 election observers to various constituencies across Zimbabwe in preparation for the upcoming elections Speaking at a press conference in the capital, Harare, Commissioner-General Godwin Matanga said police had already increased visibility through focused deployments throughout the country in the build-up to the elections and would continue on the day, as well as the period after. ESR is a consortium of over 40 civil society organisations and provides a platform for citizens to report electoral malpractices. Addressing journalists in Bulawayo, a member of the ESR steering committee, Liberty Bhebhe, said the observers would only focus on political hotspots. In the meantime, Zimbabwe’s Vice-President, retired general Dr Constantino Chiwenga, who staged last year’s military coup against Robert Mugabe, is wooing the country’s Indian community ahead of Monday’s general elections. Speaking in Harare to members of the Asian community and Zanu-PF supporters, Chiwenga told them that they were not aliens, but Zimbabwean citizens, and should embrace the national development agenda, which will spell a new chapter for the country’s socio-economic development.

Most were not politically active during Zimbabwe’s war of independence, but some funnelled money to support freedom fighters. Following independence, some became prominent members in the Zanu-PF party and government. – African News Agency
