Wondering what Zuluboy is up to? Well, the rapper is set to launch a soap product in September Zuluboy, whose real name is Mxolisi Majozi, saw the opportunity after he was labelled “dirty” on Twitter when he posted his picture alongside that of poet-singer Ntsiki Mazwai. The actor and hip-hop star turned the criticism into a business venture. In an interview with Sowetan, the rapper said there was a perception that he doesn’t wash. He said he was recently told that he doesn’t take a bath because he is saving water, but that didn’t bother him.

He said it is part of the grooming range he planned to release in future. “The soap smells nice, like other soaps. It can be used by both men and women. I have included some traditional herbs, such as impepho and other herbs that are used to wash away bad luck,” he was quoted as saying. Earlier this month, the star appeared on SABC1’s popular telenovela Uzalo. He enters the show as Last-Namba, the younger brother of pimp Amos, played by Ernest Msibi. At the time of his first appearance, Zuluboy said he was excited to join the show.
