Thousands of South Africans and dignitaries gathered at the Wanderers Stadium to hear former US President Barack Obama deliver the 16th annual Nelson Mandela Lecture The lecture, in partnership with the Motsepe Foundation, comes a day before Nelson Mandela International Day and is themed: “Renewing the Mandela Legacy and Promoting Active Citizenship in a Changing World.” The Nelson Mandela Foundation said the lecture would focus on “creating conditions for bridging divides, working across ideological lines, and resisting oppression and inequality”. When announcing Obama as this year’s speaker in April, foundation CEO Sello Hatang explained: “We thought to ourselves: ‘Who can best represent the legacy of Madiba? Who took the baton when he became President of his own country? Who would be able to deal with issues of democracy in a world ripped apart by corruption?’… We needed an African person.” Check out our tweets from our team at the lecture.
