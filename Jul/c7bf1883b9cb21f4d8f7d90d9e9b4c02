Embattled retail giant Edcon is calling time on stand-alone Red Square and La Senza stores, as the company's turnaround strategy intensifies Edcon CEO Grant Pattison is settling into his new position as CEO of the ailing group and top of his agenda are reducing the number of stores the group operates and plans to slash floorspace by 17% over the next five years, Bloomberg reports. Going forward, Pattison says the group’s focus will predominantly be centred around pushing Edgars, Jet and CNA stores, as opposed to stand-alone stores that have come under severe pressure in recent years due to an economy that is barely growing and declining consumer spending. According to the report, Edcon also plans on pulling the plug on high-end homeware chain Boardmans. Edson’s shutdown of La Senza stores comes less than five years after the group acquired the local franchise rights to the lingerie brand.

Brookes even hired 2 500 new employees to improve the group’s customer service experience, but these strategies failed to deliver the desired outcomes.
