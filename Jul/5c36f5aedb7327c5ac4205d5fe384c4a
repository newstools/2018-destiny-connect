Entrepreneur and radio personality Sibusiso Leope, aka DJ Sbu, feels taken advantage of after fraudsters used his name and image in a scam that claims to have developed a cure for HIV/Aids DJ Sbu is piping mad and he has every right to be. His image has been used in a fake testimonial in which the businessman claims to have been cured of the virus after taking a spirulina-based cure developed by a doctor referred to in the pamphlet as Dr Zimwe. Taking to Instagram this week, Leope expressed his disappointment at the scam and slammed the fraudsters for cutting corners instead of hustling hard.

Ironically, Leope himself landed in hot water three years ago when he posted a fake image of himself featuring on the cover of Forbes Africa.

It turned out to be an exercise in guerrilla marketing which, depending on which side of the argument you stand, was a brilliant marketing campaign or caused him and his brand long-term reputational damage.
