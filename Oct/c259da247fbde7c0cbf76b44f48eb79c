The entrepreneur, who co-owns the clothing line with footballer hubby Siphiwe Tshabalala, has signed a deal with Jet. The line and a doll range are now available in stores. “When we launched this, a lot of people didn’t understand why we would do this of all things and my husband/business partner and I just kept our eyes on our dream,” she said in an excited Instagram post on Monday. “We are selling a message of hope and installing confidence and self-esteem in the African child. We want African children to know they too can be great, that they too can be seen as a symbol of beauty and success.” SB Kids clothing was launched late last year and features a line for girls designed by Bokang, featuring images of “Princess Bokang” and a boys line designed by Tshabalala called “Super Shabba”.
