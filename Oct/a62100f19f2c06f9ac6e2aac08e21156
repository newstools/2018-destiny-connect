Staring down the barrel of unemployment is a reality too many young South Africans face. It could have been Dayile’s fate too, but she took a leap of faith when she launched her own nail and eyelash salon, Royal Nails, in 2016. Its humble beginnings can be traced back to her days at the Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University, where she was studying management. “Getting my nails done was very expensive and I couldn’t afford it at the time,” recalls the 21-year-old. “So I thought of teaching myself to do them and then offering a quality, but affordable nail service to other students too.” Using her pocket money, Dayile bought herself a small nail kit and some equipment and, after trimming, buffing and painting the nails of several students, more and more of them began knocking on her door. It was then that she decided to put class theory into practice and formalise her business.
