The young woman from Limpopo enrolled for a construction management and quantity surveying course instead. She then continued her studies with a BTech in Construction Management from Tshwane University of Technology. “While I was studying, I began to realise the importance of construction. A strong construction industry equals a strong economy,” she says. After completing her studies, she began working at C-Pro Construction, where she met her mentor Jannie Smith.
