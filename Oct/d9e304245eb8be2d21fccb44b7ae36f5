Pretoria-born businesswoman Nthabiseng Etoma-Marengwa, who has started three businesses in five years and now employs 11 people, plans to open her own nail manicure academy. “I run three businesses, the beauty spa, an ice-making supply business and a laundromat,” Etoma-Marengwa said while manicuring a client at one of her businesses, Mzansi Skin & Beauty Spa, in Diepkloof, Soweto. Etoma-Marengwa worked for two telecommunications companies before she decided to pursue her passion for business. “I got experience of running a business through working at various corporate companies. I’m a hard worker and thought, let me try to start my own business, which is when I opened my laundromat in Fairlands.”
