Gauteng is officially home to the most tech start-up businesses in the country, with 55% of survey respondents businesses based in the province, compared to 37% in the Western Cape. The rise in Gauteng tech start-ups has predominantly been driven by a big spike in the number of black tech entrepreneurs who now make up 56% of the country’s tech start-ups – an increase from 26% in 2015. While the growth is encouraging, it’s apparent that black entrepreneurs are struggling as the data reveals that just 7% of black-owned tech start-ups are profitable. White tech entrepreneurs seem to have a much better success rate, with 15% of white-owned tech businesses making a profit.
