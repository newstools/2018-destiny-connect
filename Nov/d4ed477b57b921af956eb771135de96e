Celebrating both the traditional and modern African aesthetic is a balance Refiloe Khobane, founder and designer of 100% handcrafted contemporary African-inspired accessories brand Ovazania, has honed since its launch in 2016. We caught up with the Katlehong-raised and Australia-based graphic designer to find out more about her journey, inspiration and doing business abroad. You studied film, so what led you to create jewellery and found Ovazania? I have always had a passion for accessories, design, fashion, film and visual communication. After a brief career in film I went on to study graphic design, and later developed Ovazania out of an incessant need to create something of my own. I don’t have any formal training in jewellery-making, so it was quite literally taking a leap of faith and trying something new.
