Founded by three female entrepreneurs, sisters Hope Lukoto, Tshilidzi Makhari and Kelebogile Mashigo, Kurlz & Kutz is a haircare salon for all types of hair. The salon is designed to take the guesswork out of which haircare products work for its customers. Lukoto, a mother of two and a clinical psychologist with a Master’s in Psychology from the University of Pretoria, a coach and HR professional, says her young daughter’s hair needs were the inspiration behind the business. “I enjoy imparting good grooming skills to both my kids, teaching them to love themselves, to love taking care of themselves and appreciate who they are.” The three women identified a gap in the market for children’s haircare services from the perspective of the appropriate environment as well as haircare products. Makhari, a married mother of two daughters, who is currently an investment professional with a chemical engineering background from Wits University, says the salon was born out of the countless frustrations she and her eldest daughter experienced each time they went to a salon. “The issues we faced ranged from the hostile environment as we entered the salon imposed by the sound of blow driers, big overwhelming chairs, adults milling around, etc, to dealing with stylists asking me if they can use some relaxer products to soften her natural hair to make it more manageable.
