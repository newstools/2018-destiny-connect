New research conducted by consultancy firm The Human Edge, has found that millennials – which will make up 50% of the world’s workforce in less than two years – think the traditional performance review that happens once or twice a year (if you’re lucky) is a waste of time. Instead, millennials say they would benefit more from continuous engagement with their managers throughout the year as opposed to an annual assessment. “It’s time we seriously think about eradicating the outdated annual performance review,” says The Human Edge Business Director Helene Vermaak. “In fact millennials, who according to Gallup Inc will by the year 2020 make up 50% of the global workforce, don’t understand why they must wait an entire year to learn how they’re performing in the job, they’re accustomed to instant gratification.”
