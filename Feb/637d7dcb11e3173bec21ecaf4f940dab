Zimbabwe's anti-graft agency has said that the ongoing investigation into Grace Mugabe's controversially acquired PhD will not lead to the arrest of the former First Lady According to New Zimbabwe.com, Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Committee (ZACC) Chairperson Gordon Nguni said that Mugabe could have been an “innocent beneficiary of a fraudulent academic degree”. Mugabe, whose husband resigned in November under pressure from the military, received the doctorate in 2014 amid allegations she did not study for it. She was awarded the degree after just months of study. Former President Robert Mugabe was University of Zimbabwe (UZ) Chancellor at the time. Doctorates typically require several years of full-time research and writing.

This came amid reports that the anti-graft agency was investigating one of the UZ lecturers who supervised Grace’s PhD thesis.
