The Academy Awards are almost upon us and we’re looking back at the 5 beauty looks that stole our breaths away on Oscar night. 2018 is set to be a banner year for inclusivity at the Academy Awards as black-led films like “Get Out” and “Mudbound” as well as films with LGBTQ storylines like “Call Me By Your Name” and ” The Shape of Water” have found themselves nominated for one of Hollywood’s top honors. To celebrate this, we take a look at 5 Oscar night beauty looks that black women rocked. Ruth Negga, Oscars 2017 Ethiopian-Irish actress, Ruth Negga, who was nominated for a best actress award in 2017 pulled off the monotone make-up look to perfection with gorgeous tones of red as she matched her scarlet lips and burgundy eyes to her crown and earrings. Lupita Nyong’o, Oscars 2014 Lupita first graced the Oscar’s red carpet with a stunning and simple hairstyle few had seen before, an alice band holding back her afro that had been tonged in sections to create texture and shaved sides. A hairstyle perfect for picking up her well-deserved “12 Years a Slave” golden statue win.  Halle Berry, Oscars 2002 On the night Halle Berry made history as the first black woman to win a Best Actress Academy Award, she also popularized her signature pixie cut which went on to inspire black women to create similar hairstyles with weaves and wigs as well as their own hair.  Zendaya, Oscars 2015 Actress Zendaya Coleman wore her hair in Goddess Dreadlocks to attend the 2015 Academy Awards, which she complimented with pretty understated nude make-up for a natural and ethereal look. Taraji P. Henson, Oscars 2017 A classic, modern and yet spunky blue smokey eye (to match her dress) and two-toned honey and brown bob were the look for Taraji P. Henson’s walk down the Oscar red carpet.
