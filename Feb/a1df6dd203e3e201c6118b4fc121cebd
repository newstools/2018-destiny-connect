Outgoing Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini survives another Cabinet reshuffle, but will no longer oversee the nation's social grants scheme In a surprise move, the under-fire Dlamini was kept on to serve in President Cyril Ramaphosa’s new Cabinet, which was announced on Monday, despite multiple failures to meet the SA Social Security Agency’s (Sassa’s) obligations to the Constitutional Court. Dlamini – who is also the ANC Women’s League President – was reshuffled to become the Minister for Women in the Presidency. She swops portfolios directly with predecessor, Minister Susan Shabangu, who moves in the opposite direction to head up the Department of Social Development. Her retention as a Minister has been mooted as a strategy to keep the ANC Women’s League satisfied, while the portfolio as a whole may be collapsed once Ramaphosa reconfigures the size of his Cabinet. Dlamini has endured a torrid 18 months since the run-up to the first failure to meet the Constitutional Court deadline to find a new service provider for the social grants scheme in March last year.

She is currently the subject of an inquiry into whether she should be held personally liable for the social grants distribution crisis. Closing arguments will resume on 19 March. Her department also came under fire for paying nearly R150 000 for Dlamini to give an interview on the SABC in August. And it hasn’t stopped for the embattled ANCWL President. Just this week, the South African Human Rights Commission subpoenaed her in relation to the Commission’s National Investigative Hearing on the Status of Mental Health Care in the country. The commission wants to compel Dlamini to make submissions to the hearings, after she failed to respond to numerous requests.

Leadership of the Sassa issue though was transferred to an inter-ministerial committee in December, headed up by the Minister of Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation in the Presidency. Minister Jeff Radebe held that position formerly, but was replaced on Monday by none other than ANC presidential runner-up Dr Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma. Radebe moves to the energy ministry. The inter-ministerial committee has just 33 days to ensure a smooth handover of the social grants scheme from current service provider Cash Paymaster Services to the South African Post Office by 1 April. Dlamini will no longer have any official involvement in the migration of the grants scheme. – News24
