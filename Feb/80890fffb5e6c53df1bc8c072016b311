Although the controversial politician, also known as “The Cat”, has positioned himself as a clean leader, seeking to unite and root out corruption in both his political party and the country, Mabuza is perceived by some in the ANC as a dirty politician, who has ruled his home province with an iron fist. Mabuza, who has sought to distance the ANC from the Gupta family, who are accused of using their close relationship with former President Jacob Zuma to siphon money from the country through its control of some members of the executive and operations at state-owned enterprises, admitted that the family offered him a lift to Moscow, Russia, when he was seeking medical intervention after he was poisoned. – News24
