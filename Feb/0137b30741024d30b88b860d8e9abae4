In her upcoming memoir, Becoming, Michelle Obama reveals her captivating life “Writing Becoming has been a deeply personal experience,” said former US First Lady Michelle Obama about her memoir. “It has allowed me, for the very first time, the space to honestly reflect on the unexpected trajectory of my life.” Her book takes readers through her public and private triumphs and disappointments in a story that is endearingly honest and witty.  Obama said she wrote about her roots, how she found her voice as a little girl growing up in the south of Chicago and developed the strength to use it to empower others.

As First Lady of the US — the first African-American to serve in that role — she made the White House welcoming and inclusive, and established herself as an outspoken advocate for women and girls globally. On the lighter side of the Obama Presidency, she also managed to show off killer dance moves and crushed Carpool Karaoke on The Late Late Show with James Corden.  The book will be released on 13 November 2018 around the world, including audio and digital editions. Becoming will be translated into 23 other languages too. Once released, Obama will embark on a US and international book tour, with details to be announced at a later date. Celebrities and fans alike are excited.   “I hope my journey inspires readers to find the courage to become whoever they aspire to be,” Obama said. “I can’t wait to share my story.”
