Are you always busy, stressed and frantic? Find out how to reclaim your time and your life In today’s fast-paced world, people are often expected to be switched on 24/7, but all work and no play not only leads to physical and mental exhaustion, but it also affects your relationships and hampers your personal growth. Life coach Penny Holburn says that in order for you to function well in any aspect of your life, you need to spend some time on yourself.  “It’s crucial that you prioritise and plan your time. You need downtime to rid yourself of stress and to relax so that when you are with your loved ones, you can be present in the moment.” She adds that people are expected to juggle many responsibilities, which can lead to feeling overwhelmed. “With the current financial climate, many people are feeling the need to work longer hours in order to keep their jobs and demonstrate their worth. There is then added pressure to spend enough time with your family and friends and smartphones require you to be in constant contact.” Holburn suggests reclaiming your time by avoiding these time-sinkers: Long commutes: A long commute to and from work can rob you of hours each day. Consider travelling at times when the traffic isn’t at its worst or ask your manager if you can work flexi-hours. Being switched on constantly: While SMS, email, WhatsApp, Facebook and Instagram allow you to be in contact all the time, it also means that you never really switch off. These constant interruptions waste your time, break your concentration and interfere with your alone time, so it’s advisable to switch your phone off for at least two hours each day. Procrastination: Don’t put off tasks as this kills time. Just get on with it. A lack of planning: It isn’t necessary to live your entire life according to a schedule, but planning does allow you to accomplish more and not neglect the important things. How to take back control
