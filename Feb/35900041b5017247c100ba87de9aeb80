Experts believe increases in value-added tax (Vat) and fuel levies will have a negative impact on all South Africans, but will hit the poorest of the poor the hardest Debt Rescue CEO Neil Roets welcomed the continuation of the policy of zero rating staple foods like maize, brown bread and beans, but indicated the reality was that even poor South Africans consumed a multitude of items on which they were now going to pay 15% Vat. “However, Finance Minister wants to spin the increase, the reality is that everybody is now being penalised to fill the gaping fiscal hole left by almost a decade of misrule by an incompetent President and his captured cohorts,” said Roets. He said it remained to be seen whether measures announced by Minister Malusi Gigaba to stimulate growth and create employment opportunities for the millions of unemployed would be realised. “The harsh reality is that we at Debt Rescue are experiencing our highest growth rate ever because of deeply indebted consumers seeking relief from their crushing debts by being placed under legal debt review. “This is the direct result of more consumers who are unable to pay their outstanding debts and who choose to go under debt review,” he said. Roets said it was disconcerting that there had been a “disturbing” increase in the outstanding amounts of debt that consumers had ratcheted up that they now had to deal with. “Debt counselling and the follow-up process of being placed under debt review has for a growing number of South Africans become the last remaining option of hanging on to their meagre belongings while they repay their debt in smaller amounts over a longer period of time,” he said. Whether rating agencies would buy into Gigaba’s rosy picture of a growing economy and reduced level of poverty and unemployment, it remained to be seen. “My personal view and that of economists that we have consulted with remain that it took nearly a decade of misrule to dig the hole that we now find ourselves in and that is going to take a long time before the damage can be undone.”
