I was able to establish my company, which currently employs six people and I am definitely looking forward to expanding operations,” Lephoko said. “My company produces a wide variety of products, ranging from card-holders and wallets to leather belts and handbags and I also do the furniture range where I manufacture cushions, chairs and couches and a little bit of clothing.” Lephoko said that she would like to expand and that she already had a business plan in place to do so.
