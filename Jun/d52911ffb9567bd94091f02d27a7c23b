State power utility Eskom said on Tuesday there was a high probability of rotational load shedding in the evening as a result of the power system being constrained by the evening peak period due to increased demand “The power system is expected to be severely constrained this evening from 5pm-9pm, with a high risk of load shedding. Electricity users are urged to alleviate pressure on the national grid by switching off all non-essential lights, appliances, pool pumps and geysers,” spokesperson Khulu Phasiwe said. Eskom said at the weekend the system remained constrained and would take up to 10 days to recover from the effects of the industrial action by its workers, which was characterised by sabotage of its stations, including coal management and transportation. Load shedding is a last-resort measure to protect the power system from a total collapse or blackout. Stage one requires 1 000MW to be rotationally load-shed nationwide, stage 2 requires 2 000MW, stage 3 requires 3 000MW, and stage 4 calls for up to 4 000MW to be rotationally load-shed nationally.

Labour unions are demanding a 15% increase for workers at Eskom, saying their members should not suffer for a financial crisis brought on by corruption and mismanagement by senior executives who have since been fired. – African News Agency
