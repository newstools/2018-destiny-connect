For the first time, all six of the South African participants in the national team attending the International Mathematics Olympiad (IMO) come from schools in Cape Town In a statement, Debbie Schäfer, Western Cape MEC for Education, said that for the past four years, five out of the six members of the national team had been from the Western Cape, but that this is the first time that Cape Town has scored six out of six. The South African team will attend the 59th International Mathematics Olympiad taking place in Romania from 3-14 July. The SA team was selected by the South African Mathematics Foundation in talent search and includes Adri Wessels and Ralph McDougall (both of Curro Durbanville), Emil van der Walt (Jan van Riebeeck High School), Emile Tredoux (Parklands College), Taariq Mowzer (Fairbairn College) and Tim Schlesinger (Rondebosch Boys’ High School).
