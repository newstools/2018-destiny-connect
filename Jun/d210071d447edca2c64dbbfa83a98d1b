South African personalities came out to celebrate "moments that bring joy to their lives" at the annual Moët Grand Day on Saturday, 9 June, at the Four Seasons The Westcliff’s Arcadia Ballroom. The star-studded event’s guest list included entertainment to business royalty, including Boitumelo “Boity” Thulo, Luthando “Lootlove” Shosha, Dineo Moeketsi, Khanya Mkangisa and Kelly Khumalo. “The name Moët & Chandon is synonymous today with celebration because for 275 years, we have combined our ‘savoir-faire’ (know-how) with our own art of the fête (party) to perfect a unique ‘savoir-fête’ that has made our champagnes a great choice for toasting both intimate moments and important milestones,” said Patrick Leslie, Moët Hennessy Champagne Portfolio Brand Manager. Guests came out in their best red-carpet-worthy ensembles in keeping with the event’s “Gold is Grand” theme. Celebrity cook and TV host Lorna Maseko – who wore a dashing fitted sequinned mini – being presented with the award for “most glamorous”, while the title of “most stylish” went to Troy Molaiwa and her black coat embellished with gold buttons. As champagne flowed from the gold six-litre illuminated Moët & Chandon bottle feature, Moët & Chandon Impérial, Nectar Impérial and Nectar Imperial Rosé were served. Guests also enjoyed mini-magnums from Africa’s first Moët & Chandon vending machine, while DJ Lerato Kganyago kept the dancefloor hot. To seal the night’s festivities, gold confetti was released from a golden buzzer at the end of a countdown culminating in a group toast.
