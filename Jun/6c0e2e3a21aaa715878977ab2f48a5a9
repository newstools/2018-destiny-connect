Not only are these DIY beauty tips easy and affordable enough for every woman to try, but they’ll awaken your creative side too HOMEMADE EXFOLIATOR As the weather cools down down, skin becomes harder to maintain. The best way to keep it fresh and hydrated is by exfoliating twice a week, as this opens the pores, allowing them to absorb products. How: Combine 1 cup brown sugar with five or six tablespoons of olive oil. Massage onto clean skin and rinse off after 10-15 minutes.   CAT-EYE PERFECTION Achieving sultry and exotic cat-eyes can make you wish you had a make-up artist on speed-dial – it’s a tricky skill to master. Fortunately, sketching the perfect winged eye just got easier, thanks to Scotch tape! How to: Stick the tape at the outer corner of the eye and another small piece on the lower lash line. Then fill the space in between with eyeliner.  BABY POWDER LASHES Say “goodbye” to false lashes and thicken your natural ones by curling them, using either a curler or warm fingertips. Then apply one coat of mascara. How to: With a small brush, lightly dust loose baby powder over your lashes. Apply the second coat of mascara and watch each strand thicken like magic!   TOOTHBRUSH TACTICS A toothbrush can be used to unclump eyelashes, straighten brows and smooth edges. How to: Spritz a little hairspray on the bristles of an old toothbrush before using it to straighten brows or level edges.  HOLDING SPRAY FOR MAKE-UP Have a long night ahead? Set your make-up by spraying holding spray onto your face. How to: Tilt your head back, close your eyes and spray from the top, about 15cm from your face.   NATURAL MAKE-UP REMOVER Coconut oil is not only an excellent body moisturiser, but also works like a charm to remove make-up, especially the stubborn, water-resistant type. How to: Rub a small amount of coconut oil between your fingers and then spread it all over your face, massaging it smoothly. Remove with make-up wipes or damp cotton pads.
