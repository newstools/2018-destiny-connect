Liberty CEO David Munro has confirmed that hackers targeted emails and attachments last week after its security system was breached and sensitive information stolen The confirmation comes as an investigation launched by the financial services company last week nears an advanced stage. While Liberty is unable to divulge any further detail, it says it is working painstakingly hard to reassure clients their investments remain secure and that the breach will not lead to financial loss. “Of course, there are wide ramifications when data is leaked. We’re going to have to make sure we do everything we can do address that. But it does really go to the nature of the documentation that has been stolen from us. It’s largely email and attachments at this point in time. That’s what we understand,” Munro said. “There’s been no financial loss on investments and none of our policy documentation has been compromised at all.” READ MORE: In light of celebrity hacks, how to protect your data Hackers attempted to extort ransom money from Liberty for the data stolen, claiming it had highly sensitive information about top clients it would release if millions of rands aren’t paid to them, but the company has not bowed to pressure. Liberty was alerted to the breach on its IT network on Thursday evening and the theft is being investigated by the police. On Sunday, the alleged group of hackers released a public statement of their own in response to Liberty claiming to be in possession of 40TB of hacked data that they are now threatening to unleash, according to an iAfrikan report. “We are still holding 40TB that will be published in a few parts, every day. The database file includes customer data, finance data, full email backup of directors and more interesting data,” the hackers are quoted saying.
