Could Zukie Siyotula be headed for a position on the SA Reserve Bank's (Sarb) board of directors? Aged 34, Siyotula would certainly be the youngest member of Sarb’s 15 director board should she win the seat and it would come hot off the heels of her recent appointment on to the newly constituted Denel board. According to a Business Insider report, the Sarb has until its annual general meeting, scheduled for 27 July, to fill the Non-Executive Director seat that is specially reserved for a professional with a background in finance or commerce and a person who doesn’t work in banking or for the government. A business powerhouse and young leader, Siyotula is a chartered accountant who holds an MBA. She’s a former Thebe Capital CEO, a post she was appointed to before turning 30, and has served on a host of major boards, including the likes of Shell SA, Altech Netstar, Vodacom and SAfripol. Siyotula will face off against Dr Zethu Qunta and Dr Yvonne Muthien for the person. Qunta, currently Chairperson of the Railway Safety Regulator, is  a long-serving public servant with extensive government finance experience. She holds a doctorate in development finance, an MBA from a British institution and Master’s in economics. Having worked for some of the top companies in the country, including Coca-Cola, MTN and Sanlam, Muthien is also a seasoned board Director, previously serving on the boards of state-owned enterprises like the SABC, Transnet and Sentech. Muthien holds a doctorate from Oxford University in sociology and politics and a Master’s from Northwestern University.
