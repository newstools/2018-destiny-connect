The devastating drought experienced in the region over the past two years has wreaked havoc on the province’s tourism figures. Tourism Minister Derek Hanekom said scores of tourists have been scared off by all the messaging that came out around Day Zero. “Reports that we get from hotel groups is that their forward bookings, especially in Cape Town, were seriously affected by the drought. There have been cancellations by people who were not sure the drought would be over when they arrived. They had heard about Day Zero,” he was quoted saying in a BusinessLive report. Now that hotel prices are dropping and with the rainy season upon the Cape, the hope is that tourists will resume travel to the region.
