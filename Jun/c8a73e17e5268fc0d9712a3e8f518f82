A woman who was forced off a Kulula flight for referring to the pilot using the K-word has lost her job as a result of the fallout Alochna Moodley finds herself without a job after admitting to have called two black passengers – Reverend Solumuzi Mabuza and Sibusiso Magubane – and the flight’s captain, Menzi Mvelase, the K-word, SowetanLive reports. Moodley’s employer, SMC Pneumatics, said the company has taken a zero-tolerance stance on racism and dismissed her with immediate effect. “A recent incident has been brought to the company’s attention. At SMC, we do not tolerate any form of racism. With regards to the recent events, the employee no longer works for SMC South Africa,” SMC MD Kevin O’Carroll was quoted as saying.

Mabuza, who was seated next to Moodley on the flight, noticed her typing the word in a text message in reference to black people on the flight, complaining to the message recipient that one was drunk, while the other kept sniffing. He reported the incident to flight attendants and shortly after, she was promptly escorted off the flight. Moodley has blamed her actions on the frustration of a flight delay.

Remaining defiant, however, she questioned why Mabuza had been looking over her shoulder and at her phone in the first place. “It was a mistake on my side, I am not going to deny that I said those things. Yes, it’s wrong for me to make those remarks, but it was my SMS, so why was he looking at my phone? He invaded my privacy and I feel like this thing was blown out of proportion,” she maintained.
