I went through a lot this season but with the grace of God I was able to run today, so I’m quite happy and excited. But this is a very emotional era,” Mthembu told EWN after the race. Amongst the more than 21 000 faces, were a few famous ones. Journalist and award-winning author Redi Tlhabi ran her sixth Comrades, which she described as one of her hardest yet.
