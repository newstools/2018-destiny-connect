Four municipalities in the Western Cape – George, Kannaland, Beaufort West and Oudtshoorn – are under investigation by the Hawks for fraud, racketeering and corruption Earlier reports said 11 municipalities were being probed, but DA MP Masizole Mnqasela on Friday said: “It is in fact only four”. Mnqasela said: “George, where a raid by the Hawks took place in April, is being investigated for alleged fraud and corruption, Kannaland for alleged racketeering, while Oudtshoorn and Beaufort West are being investigated for alleged fraud and corruption.” He said “it must be noted” that the investigations at Kannaland, Oudtshoorn, and Beaufort West were linked to matters that arose prior to the 2016 local government elections. “I once again commend Minister Anton Bredell and the Department of Local Government, who proactively provided information about the allegations at the George Municipality to the Hawks, who within eight days after the meeting, raided the George Municipality,” said Mnqasela.

Cederberg Municipality is being probed for alleged tender irregularities on grant funding, and Stellenbosch Municipality over similar irregularities. “It is further pleasing to note that the department has also referred supply chain challenges in the Theewaterskloof Municipality to Provincial Treasury for further investigation and support, and the alleged sale of public land in the Langeberg Municipality to the Department of the Premier’s legal services for further investigation,” said Mnqasela. – African News Agency
