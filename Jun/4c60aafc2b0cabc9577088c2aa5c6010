While natural hair is considered the new aesthetic, five professionals tell us about their relationship with relaxed hair  SIPHOKAZI VETI, WRITER
What made you choose a relaxed pixie cut?
Becoming comfortable with my body also brought the life-changing awareness that I could do whatever I wanted with my hair. I can and will relax my hair, despite society insinuating that women who do so are trying to assimilate Western culture. Your writing tackles the topics of self-image and self-awareness. Does the way you look empower you?
For us black women, our hair is our crown. When I first cut my hair, it was a way of detaching myself from this limiting definition of self and beauty. It was important for me to do it so that my hair wouldn’t define my identity. I’m more than my hair and this is the message I try to disseminate through my writing.
