The board of the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa) has urged all staff and management to give the newly appointed group CEO all the support he will need during what will be a challenging period Prasa on Tuesday announced Sibusiso Sithole as its new group CEO for a period of 12 months, effective 1 June 2018. Sithole, the former City Manager of eThekwini Municipality, will take over from Cromet Molepo who had been the acting in the position since December 2017. Board Chairperson Khanyisile Kweyama said Sithole’s appointment came at an opportune moment, and urged him to hit the ground running. “Mr Sithole is quite aware of the immense challenges facing the organisation. Prasa is at its worst performance levels and there is an expectation from the public that we serve for the organisation to turn itself around,” Kweyama said. “We cannot overemphasise what our expectation as a board is from the CEO. Fortunately with the kind of experience he has, we should not expect any difficulty in him executing the task at hand.” Prasa said it appointed Sithole, a turnaround strategist and policy specialist, to bring stability and certainty to the embattled state-owned rail agency.
