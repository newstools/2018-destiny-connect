You don't need to ditch your favourite summer fashion items in the dead of winter Summer dressing is generally a lot easier; T-shirts, dresses, hats, sunglasses and you’re done. Now that we’re confronted by colder, winter weather, getting dressed can be a little more challenging. Fear not, however, because you can use your summer items to look chic and chill-ready. Dresses Let’s look at your favourite summer dresses, from the maxi-dress to the slip dress. You may think these should be the first to be chucked to the back of your cupboard as soon as winter approaches, but layer your dresses with a turtle- or polo-neck and don some thick stockings, and you are good to go. Alternatively, you can turn your dress into a winter skirt by adding a sweater and boots.    Shorts This is not for every lady, but if you are a “shorts” kind of person, you can definitely make use of a pair that is stylish, elegant and not too short. Wear tights or thick stockings underneath, and pair this look with ankle boots and a jacket.    Accessories South African winters are still a good time for our go-to accessories. Your favourite hat and sunglasses can be put to great use when lifting a look that you may feel is lacking that little something.   Jumpsuit The jumpsuit is an easy, go-to piece that doesn’t require much thought for you to pull off. Should you have a sleeveless jumpsuit, add a long-sleeved crew-neck top underneath and possibly ankle boots, depending on the occasion.    Colour Cloudy days may not inspire you to whip out their brightest and most cheerful items, mainly because we associate them with summer. Colour is the best and simplest way to spruce up the morbid tones associated with winter. Be fearless and bold with colour and patterns.   All clothing available at Woolworths, woolworths.co.za
