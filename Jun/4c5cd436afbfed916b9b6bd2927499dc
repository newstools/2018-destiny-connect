The South African Institute of Chartered Accountants (Saica) said on Tuesday it had charged disgraced former Eskom CFO Anoj Singh with misconduct following an extensive investigation Singh resigned from Eskom in January after being placed on suspension by the power utility in September 2017, following allegations that he was involved in irregularly awarding contracts to Gupta-linked businesses, and also received gifts and trips from the controversial family. Saica said in a statement that Singh had conducted himself in a manner which was “discreditable, dishonourable, dishonest, irregular or unworthy, or which is derogatory to the institute, or tends to bring the profession of accountancy into disrepute”.
