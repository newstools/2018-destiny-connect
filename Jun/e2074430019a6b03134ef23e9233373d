First-time home-buyers and owners who are eager to sell often wait in anticipation to get feedback from the bank on the status of a home loan application Stanley Mabulu, Channel Management Head at FNB Home Loans says the amount of time it takes for a home loan application to be approved depends on several factors, impacting both the bank and customers. “Ideally, it should take a minimum of one week to get complete approval. However, due to application backlogs, delays or customers not meeting certain requirements, the process can be delayed for two to four weeks at most,” adds Mabulu.

You can also achieve this by requesting a pre-approval from your bank to determine how much you qualify for. “When applying for a home loan, it is important to ensure that you have provided the bank with all the information required.

Consumers who require clarity about the home loan application process are encouraged to contact their bank for assistance.
