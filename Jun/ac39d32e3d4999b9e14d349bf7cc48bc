KFC is not misleading the public with its four Zinger wing offering, despite the fact that it's actually two full wings cut in half, the Advertising Standards Authority of SA (ASA) has ruled This is because there is no proper definition of a “wing”. Relying on industry norms and citing practices employed by competitors including Chicken Licken, Hungry Lion, Spur and Burger King – whose chicken wings are all sold as winglets – KFC was able to successfully defend the complaint lodged by Shaakir Ismail with the ASA. KFC’s saving grace was the fact that underneath the image of the wings used in its advertising campaign, the pieces are described as “winglets”. “The illustration of the hot Zinger wings makes it clear that the respondent is selling half-wings. In addition, the description immediately below the words “4 hot Zinger wings” clarifies that the wings are actually “winglets” and not full wings,” the ASA said in its ruling.

The directorate also found that, as required by the Health Department, as long as the advertisement image is a “truthful representation” of what the consumer can reasonably expect to receive, there’s nothing misleading about it. Ismail’s complaint was therefore dismissed.
