4th STREET has been named the fastest-growing wine brand globally for the second year in a row by the International Wine and Spirit Research (IWSR) and is listed in the top 20 in the world “This is a sensational win for the brand as it shows significant growth, moving from 28th place in 2016 to number 19 this year, placing us in the Top 20 internationally,” says Brand Strategy Manager Dè-Mari Shaw. With over 40 years of experience, the IWSR monitors 157 markets to produce the most trusted beverage analysis, analysing over 4 600 still wines and over 5 000 brand lines annually. When 4th STREET launched its Sweet Rosé in 2009, amidst a growing market of rosé drinkers, the wine scene was considered sophisticated, complicated and for older consumers. They introduced a more modern lifestyle brand, perfect for wine lovers who aspire to the sophistication of wine without its daunting complexity. This was a clear disruptor of the market at the time. With the successful launch of its rosé, the brand then expanded to include red and white varietals, which has taken the brand from strength to strength.

It’s the “wine to seen with” and adds an extra touch of “sociability and good times to any occasion”, said Shaw. “[It] offers consumers unintimidating sophistication with a vibrant, easy-drinking range of wines that are relevant to a new generation who want to enjoy wine their way,” said Shaw.
