A woman was reportedly removed from a Kulula flight on Friday evening, after another passenger heard her call the pilot the K-word Nadine Watkins, who was on the fight, tweeted that the plane had turned back to OR Tambo, after an “unsavoury passenger called the captain the K-word”. “Our flight might be 10 minutes late, but as South Africans, we can’t allow this type of behaviour to continue,” she tweeted.  Elaborating on the incident in a follow up tweet, Watkins said the woman had apparently been on her phone with her boyfriend, and the passenger sitting next to her had overheard her calling the pilot the K-word.
