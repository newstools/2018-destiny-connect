The Nelson Mandela Foundation, in collaboration with Kisua Africa, brings back the 466/64 clothing line in celebration of the Nelson Mandela centenary The non-profit foundation, which is the custodian of his life and a committed facilitator of his living legacy, came together with the unique fashion brand Kisua, which takes inspiration from traditional African techniques and materials and blends them with a contemporary design aesthetic and ethical production methods. The 466/64 fashion brand takes its name from the prison number of Mandela, the young, defiant revolutionary fighter whose actions fuelled a movement that changed South Africa forever. He was prisoner number 466 in the year 1964. 466/64 will have a new, youth-focused, socially-conscious brand direction, that will honour the legacy of Madiba by providing financial support to his humanitarian efforts, through the work of the Nelson Mandela Children’s Hospital and the Nelson Mandela Foundation. This first instalment is a combination of affordable casual wear in the form of T-shirts, hoodies and accessories like berets, military and baseball caps that celebrate different facets of Madiba’s life.
