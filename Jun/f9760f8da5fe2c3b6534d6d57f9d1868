Convicted murderer Henri van Breda will know his fate today, as the Western Cape High Court is set to hand down a sentence for the 2015 murders of his parents and older brother, as well as the attempted murder of his sister Earlier this week, the state argued in aggravation of sentence that the 23-year-old Henri van Breda had shown no remorse for the January 2015 murders at the Van Breda family home in the De Zalze security estate in Stellenbosch. The state said that his sister, Marli van Breda, who was 16 at the time of the attack and barely survived, has to grow up alone with the knowledge that her own brother killed her family. Throughout the trial, Van Breda maintained his innocence, claiming instead that a laughing, axe-wielding attacker, also armed with a knife, was behind the murders. However, Judge Siraj Desai dismissed his version as “nonsensical” and found him guilty on three counts of murder, one of attempted murder, as well as defeating the ends of justice.
