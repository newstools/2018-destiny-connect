The South African Communist Party (SACP) wants Cape Town International Airport to be renamed after late struggle icon Chris Hani The Department of Transport and the Airports Company South Africa (Acsa) have been hosting public meetings this week over changing the airport’s name. Earlier this week, tempers flared when members of the EFF, who want the airport named after Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, clashed with Gatvol Capetonians members, who said she had never been part of the province. The SACP’s Western Cape spokesperson, Zuko Mndayi, condemned the “criminal behaviour and intimidation” at the meetings this week. “The SACP calls for [the] recognition of Hani, one of the unquestionable giants of our liberation struggle, who served our people wholeheartedly,” Mndayi said.

For the record, the SACP has made its submission at the hearings. “The SACP’s proposal must not be prejudiced. The party respects the rule of law and human rights, and would not stoop so low in order to attract attention to its submission.” – News24
