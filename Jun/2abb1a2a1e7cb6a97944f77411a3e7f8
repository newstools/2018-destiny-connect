President Cyril Ramaphosa has apologised to Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu for "putting him through a period where he lost confidence" in the leadership of the ANC Ramaphosa met with Tutu at his house in Hermanus, Western Cape, on Thursday. “I also want to apologise for that. We put you through a period where you lost confidence in the leadership of the country,” Ramaphosa said. In 2011, Tutu said he would pray together with South Africans for the downfall of the ANC like they did for the fall of the apartheid government. His comments came after the government refused to grant his long-time friend, the Dalai Lama, a visa to attend his birthday celebrations. At the time, a visibly furious Tutu told ANC leaders during a press conference to “watch out”, warning them about becoming too complacent after winning every election since 1994.

Tutu, who is revered as the moral compass of the country, repeatedly criticised the ANC government for failing to support Tibetans, who he said were being “oppressed viciously by the Chinese”, despite the international world helping South Africa defeat apartheid. ‘This must not be a false dawn’ In a short video, Ramaphosa said: “I am sorry. It was not a pleasant moment to hear you as the Archbishop, who we always loved, expressing your loss of hope and loss of confidence. “I just wanted to say I am sorry we put you through that, but we will work very hard to regain your confidence and make you proud. We will do that.” READ MORE: ‘Arch for Arch’ tribute to Tutu planned for Cape Town Tutu, who appeared in good spirits, thanked Ramaphosa for the apology.
