The South African National Civic Organisation (Sanco) has said that the roll-out of a new and much more tolerable drug to fight multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) will save many lives Sanco was speaking following the announcement that the new drug‚ bedaquiline‚ would replace current treatment regimens for adolescents and adults from the start of their treatment. “We congratulate the National Department of Health and in particular the leadership of its Minister, Dr Aaron Motsoaledi, for concerted effort and leadership to upscale the fight against TB in our communities,” said Sanco acting spokesperson Motlalepula Rosho. Sanco quoted Dr Norbert Njeka‚ a Director in the Department of Health, those provinces not yet equipped for the roll-out “will be capacitated to do so”‚ while South Africa being the “first country to take this decision” arose from the fact that it has been the first country to “see the mass benefits of the new drug”. According to Sanco, Njeka said that up until now‚ the new drug had been rolled out in small pockets across the country‚ but this scale-up is likely to reduce the burden of the disease exponentially.

Rosho commended the commitment to intensify work to urgently find an effective vaccine that will ensure that no-one contracts TB. The interim development of rapid diagnostic test has encouraged communities to avail themselves for mass screening, she said. “We concur with Minister Motswaledi that partnership, passion, urgency and requisite activism from all sectors will be required to tackle the pandemic that has killed more people than major epidemics, Ebola, malaria, HIV, small pox, bubonic plaque, influenza and cholera all added together,” she said. – African News Agency
