Two worshippers have been killed and several wounded in a stabbing attack at a mosque in Malmesbury in the Western Cape in the early hours of Thursday morning Western Cape police confirmed that the attacker was shot dead by police. The attack comes at the end of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, and five weeks after another attack at a mosque in Verulam, KwaZulu-Natal. Provincial police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Andrè Traut said Malmesbury police were called out to the mosque in the early hours of the morning and found two people stabbed to death and several injured. “A couple of hours ago – about 3am – as people got themselves ready to pray, the suspect just got up and started stabbing the people. He was praying with them,” Malmesbury Police Constable Henry Durant told News24. No warning Fellow worshippers said there was no warning that the suspect, believed to be a foreign national in his 30s, was about to commit the violent crime.

Other people went to the Swartland Hospital,” said Durant from the scene. “This guy was not in a hurry – he was very calm – he did not run, he walked away. He had a big Rambo knife.” Police officers approached the suspect, who refused to lay down his knife and charged at the officers. “He ignored the calls and tried to attack police. He was shot and killed in the process. His death will be investigated by IPID,” Traut said. There is no identified motive for the crime yet. “We don’t know anything. There is no information, there is no motive, there’s nothing like that,” said Durant. Provincial detectives are currently combing the scene for clues.
