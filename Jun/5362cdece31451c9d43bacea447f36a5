TV personality Shashi Naidoo has been dropped by yet another enterprise The star landed herself in hot water after expressing her views on Israel and Palestine through a number of social media posts, which included her referring to Gaza as a “shithole”. This resulted in social media backlash and the local celeb being dropped by several sponsors, including Glam Palm and Lil Jewels. On Tuesday, Naidoo published a second apology on her Instagram page, saying her original statement was one she copied and pasted from a friend in an effort to appear “smart” on social media. In a statement released to the media on Tuesday afternoon, the horseracing and betting company Gold Circle announced that Naidoo’s appearance at this year’s Durban July has been cancelled.
