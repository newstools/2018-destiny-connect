Questions abound over Anele Mdoda's sudden departure from SABC3's Real Talk with Anele show While Mdoda remains mum, the official word is that she wants to pursue other career ambitions and keep growing, but some viewers aren’t entirely convinced. “Real Talk with Anele has, since the beginning of season one, been exceptionally close to my heart and I have been enormously proud to work with SABC3. I feel, for my own growth, it is time to leave the show and to focus on my career ambitions and prospects,” she said in a statement.

Hopefully, this is not the end, but a case of ‘see you later’.” After nearly two years, Mdoda will host her last show next week Friday, 8 June. Speculation has also turned to who might replace Mdoda, with Twitter users running polls suggesting her elder sister Thembisa, Pearl Modiadie, Bonang Matheba or Legato Kganyago as suitable replacements. Janez Vermeiren and Yusuf Stevens, Executive Producers of Real Talk with Anele and Cheeky Media Directors, said a search was currently underway and that further details would be announced soon.
