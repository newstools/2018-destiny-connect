A security officer, who asked to remain anonymous, previously told News24 that he feared for his life following the increase in heists. “I feel a bit safer wearing my bulletproof vest, and I observe the robbers at all times [sic]. The first thing I do in the morning is pray. That keeps me going.” According to the South African Banking Risk Information Centre, there have been 159 heists reported since the beginning of the year. Gauteng is the hardest-hit with 61 heists, followed by Mpumalanga and the Eastern Cape, both sitting on 21. The Northern Cape is the lowest, with only one heist reported. – News24
