Trade and Industry Minister Rob Davies on Thursday dissolved the board of the South African Bureau of Standards (SABS) with immediate effect for failing to exercise its fiduciary duties The charges relate to the board’s alleged complicity in the approval of the sub-standard Tegeta coal for state-owned power utility Eskom. Three board members resigned after Davies earlier this month asked them to make oral and written representations – which Davies deemed “unsatisfactory” and “unpersuasive” respectively – as to why he should not remove them from the SABS board on the back of the allegations against the crucial institution.

I have received numerous complaints regarding lack of service delivery by SABS,” Davies said. “At the same time, through the Eskom Parliamentary Inquiry process, allegations of complicity against SABS in the approval of Tegeta coal for Eskom have come to my attention.” – African News Agency
