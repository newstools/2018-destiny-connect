The ANC on Thursday announced Job Mokgoro as the new Premier of the North West province The decision to appoint Mokgoro (70) was announced by ANC Secretary-General Ace Magashule a month after Supra Mahumapelo quit the post under duress. Magashule said the decision was unanimous and he hoped that all structures within the ANC would support Mokgoro and help him bring stability to the province. The North West has been placed under administration by the national government and was shaken by weeks of violent protests demanding Mahumapelo, who was widely accused of corruption, step down. Magashule added that the national leadership of the party was given three names by provincial structures and mulled it over at length to arrive “at a decision which we hope everybody will respect”.
