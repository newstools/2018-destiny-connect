SA's GDP fell by 2,2% in the first quarter of 2018, according to a disappointing Stats SA report After growing by 3,1% in the fourth quarter of 2017, the South Africa economy faltered in the first quarter of 2018, shrinking by 2,2% quarter-on-quarter. Statistician-General Risenga Maluleke released the figures at a media briefing in Pretoria. Mining, manufacturing and agriculture were the main contributors to the slowdown, with the electricity, construction and trade industries also recording negative growth. “The 2,2% fall is the largest quarter-on-quarter decline since the first quarter of 2009. In that quarter, the economy contracted by 6,1%,” Statistics SA said on Tuesday. After recording four consecutive quarters of robust growth in 2017, however, the agriculture industry lost ground in the first quarter of this year, contracting by 24,2% – the largest quarter-on-quarter fall since the second quarter of 2006.

Mining production was down 9,9% in the first quarter following on from a decrease of 4,4% in the fourth quarter of 2017. Mining entered into recession, with a second consecutive quarter of economic decline. Statistics SA indicates that lower production in gold, platinum group metals and iron ore were the main contributors to falling performances. Manufacturing fell by 6,4%, failing to make a positive contribution to economic growth. The decline was driven largely by a fall in production of petroleum and chemical products, as well as basic iron and steel. Trade, construction and electricity industries also recorded negative growth in the first quarter of 2018, compared with the fourth quarter of 2017. Trade activity fell by 3,1%, on the back of weaker wholesale, retail and motor trade sales and lower activity in catering and accommodation.
