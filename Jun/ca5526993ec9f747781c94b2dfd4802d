Deputy President David Mabuza is expected to attend Madaraka Day, or Independence Day, celebrations in Kenya on Friday, marking the East African country’s 55th anniversary of separating from former colonial power Britain During his Kenya trip, Mabuza will also hold several meetings with leaders, including President Uhuru Kenyatta, the latest sign of improving relations between Nairobi and Pretoria. Meanwhile, Kenyans are gearing up for the day of celebrations. By 6am on Friday, thousands of Kenyans had already gathered at the Kinoru Stadium in Meru in eastern Kenya, with security forces forced to lock the gates to the terraces to the public after they had filled up, despite another 18 000 people expected to attend the event which will be presided over by Kenyatta, the Daily Nation reported. So keen were Kenyans to attend the event that some arrived as early as 3am, with long queues crowding the four gates at the stadium, and the occasional stampede disrupting proceedings. Meanwhile, security has been beefed up around the stadium and the region ahead of the celebrations. READ MORE: Who is our new Deputy President David Mabuza?
