The South African business delegation, taking part in the Outward Trade and Investment Mission (OSIM), arrived in Lagos, Nigeria, on Thursday night, for the second leg of the mission which aims to increase trade and investment between the two countries, the department of trade and industry (dti) said The visit to Nigeria was aimed at South Africa forming continuous and sustainable economic relations with West African countries in order to advance industrial development and upgrade diversification along a growth path that addresses structural constraints in the economy, including unemployment and poverty, Chief Director of Trade and Invest Africa Zanele Sanni said. “Nigeria is the biggest economy in Africa and one of the few countries with which South Africa suffers a trade deficit. The mission is therefore intended to penetrate the Nigerian market with South African-manufactured products and to further exploit investment opportunities,” she said. The Acting High Commissioner of South Africa in Nigeria, Bobby Moroe, welcomed the business delegation and said the South African government invests in international trade and investment missions in order to assist companies to contribute in creating much-needed jobs for the country’s people, dti said.
