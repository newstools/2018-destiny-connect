Good news for motorists after the Energy Department announces a 36c per litre decrease in the price of petrol, effective from 7 March Ahead of the hefty fuel levy that comes into effect next month, motorists have been given one last reprieve at the pumps for the month of March, thanks to the rand’s strength. The price of diesel will drop by 47c per litre. “The rand was trading at around R12 to the US dollar at the start of February, and has gradually strengthened to an average level approaching R11,80 for the month. Over the same period, international fuel prices dropped sharply. Although they have subsequently climbed, the increase has been moderate enough for South African fuel users to see some benefit,” the Automobile Association (AA) said. If the rand remains strong against the dollar, then international oil prices will be the main driver of petrol price changes, the AA said. The relief will however be short-lived, as motorists will be hit with a 52c per litre hike in the fuel levy, announced in the national Budget Speech last week.
