South African Olympic champion, Caster Semenya has fulfilled a long-held goal to get a university degree. So far, March is a month of big wins for Caster Semenya. Having recently broken a long-standing record, she announced yesterday on Instagram that she has graduated. In the post she can be seen sporting her famous celebratory pose dressed in a cap and gown. The caption has a simple and beautiful statement: “#mamaimadeit”. With the focus and discipline she employs in her running career, Semenya set the goal to get a tertiary qualification; and then made steady strides towards obtaining the sports science qualification. This achievement comes on Caster Semenya added another achievement to her ever-growing list of accolades with a new SA record in the women’s 1 000m at the Athletix Grand Prix Series in Pretoria a few weeks ago. “It was a tough race. The pacemaker went too quickly, so I was a little disappointed,” Semenya said after the race. “The main job of a pacemaker is to guide me, not kill me. But at the end of the day, I got a new national record, so I couldn’t ask for more. It’s fantastic.” While this pressure on the track may have pushed her to a new speed, off the track, gentle encouragement also seems to work. In a 2017 interview with DESTINY, she gave credit to her wife Violet for persuading her to return to university to achieve her dream of obtaining a sports science degree. “Running is a short-term career. I’m studying sports science so that I can work on a business. My goal is to have a sports facility, an institution for development,” she said. With a bright future ahead of her, fans should not feel dismayed that they will stop seeing her amazing wins. She’s still very focused on her athletics career and is currently training to take part in the Commonwealth Games in Australia next month.
