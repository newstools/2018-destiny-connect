The group said Shoprite and Checkers’ own brands in this category are not manufactured by these two suppliers. On Sunday supermarkets in the Shoprite Group removed and isolated all affected Enterprise processed cold meats and Rainbow Chicken polony from its fridges and delis. This followed the announcement by Minister of Health Dr Aaron Motsoaledi, after tests linked the listeria monocytogenes ST6 strain positively with these products’ supplier manufacturing plants. The group added it will do all the necessary to help the health ministry contain the listeriosis outbreak, and said it has been working closely with the Department of Health over the past months.
