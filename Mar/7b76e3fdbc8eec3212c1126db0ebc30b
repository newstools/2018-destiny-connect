The Lux brand is bringing back some favourite faces from previous campaigns - with a liberal sprinkling of influencers A flurry of social media activity by some of SA’s most-loved stars has let the cat out of the proverbial bag – Unilever’s Lux brand is working on a campaign that’s brought some very famous faces together. Using the hashtag #wearemore, Sphe Mjadu, Unilever’s Senior Public Relations Manager, was seen posing at Johannesburg’s Fairlawns Boutique Hotel with Basetsana Kumalo, Sonia Mbele and Jo-Ann Strauss, rumoured to be joining the current face of the brand, Nandi Madida, for the mysterious new campaign. Beautiful behind-the-scenes posts and Instagram stories were also posted by influencers including Palesa Mahlaba, Nomalanga Shozi, Crystal Kasper and Aqeelah Harron. The women were pictured in flowing ballgowns in front of incredible full-height flower walls of roses and other blooms. Hair maestro Saadique Ryklief, makeup artist to the stars Nthato Mashishi and designer Rich Mnisi also appeared to have worked on the campaign. The Lux brand hasn’t officially released any statements about the new campaign, but has shared some details on its social media accounts, including the fact that part of the campaign involved the new ambassadors “talking about who they are, and why they’re more than the eye can see”. The shoot also included a fragrance masterclass with Unilever’s perfumers, suggesting some exciting new Lux scents will be coming our way. We’ve collated a few of our favourite posts from the three-day shoot below.
