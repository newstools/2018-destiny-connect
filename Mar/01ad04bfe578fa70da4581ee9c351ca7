Sloane Stephens is the new US Open champion As with all sport, keeping hydrated is a key component to the success of the players on court. The tournament this week supplied players with bottled 7.4pH water with special commemorative labels to celebrate the five players. Simon Edmonds, CEO of McAlkion Water, said the refreshment was structured, micro-clustered water. “The water molecule is two to three times smaller than the normal water molecule, meaning that you will hydrate and rehydrate four to six times faster than with mineral and RO water. A sure recipe for not cramping,” said Edmonds. The water at the Brooklyn Union Axnosis ITF tournament, which has Annette du Plooy as Tournament Director, has been given a touch of class and it is hoped that the greats celebrated on each bottle will inspire the players to greater heights. – African News Agency
