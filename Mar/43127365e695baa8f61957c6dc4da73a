Former Science and Technology Minister Naledi Pandor has desscibed renowned British theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking's death as a "great loss to humanity" The world awoke to news of the legendary scientist’s death on Wednesday morning following a 55-year battle with motor neurone disease ALS. He was originally given two to three years to live after the diagnosis. Hawking (76) was globally respected for the many contributions he made to the science fraternity, particularly related to unlocking the mysteries of the universe, and for his 1988 book, A Brief History of Time, which sold over 10 million copies worldwide. “It’s a very sad day and a great loss to humanity and particularly to the science community,” Pandor said in an interview with SABC. “I think for me what he represented was an example of the ingenuity of human beings and he managed to tell us to get rid of the many prejudices that we have about persons who have disabilities.” She said ordinary people could draw inspiration from Hawking’s life because “he proved beyond doubt that talent exists everywhere”. In a statement released by the UK Press Association on Wednesday, Hawking’s children described their father as an extraordinary man whose work and legacy will live on for many years. “We are deeply saddened that our beloved father passed away today,” Professor Hawking’s children, Lucy, Robert, and Tim, said in a statement. Hawking’s mental genius and physical disability made him a household name and inspiration across the globe. He died peacefully at his home in the British university city of Cambridge in the early hours of Wednesday morning. Meanwhile Big Bang Theory fans on Twitter exhibited an outpouring of support for Sheldon Cooper, whose idol was Hawking.
