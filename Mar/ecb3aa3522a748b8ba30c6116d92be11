I am a businessman and there’s a need for condoms. I am helping people because I realised that people need a constant reminder to protect themselves against things like HIV. I happen to be in an industry where bashes and parties are some of the popular places where people tend to ‘forget themselves’, so I am here to help them,” he was quoted as saying. He told the publication that in his experience, too many people were embarrassed to take free condoms and the available brands are too costly, which is where he saw a gap. Malinga said the launch coincides with him expecting a third child and would bring up the topic of using condoms in marriage.
