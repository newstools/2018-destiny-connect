President Cyril Ramaphosa flew to Botswana last weekend in his first official visit, he flew on a private jet owned by the Moti company because the presidential jet is once again in for repairs In a picture posted on his official Twitter account, Ramaphosa showed himself arriving in Gaborone, with a Bombardier aircraft in the background. The plane has the Moti insignia on its side. Moti is a mining and property company owned by Zunaid Moti, a businessman who is no stranger to controversy. It has been in the news recently when British peer Peter Hain announced that he had been appointed as a special adviser for the Moti Group of companies. The Moti company is allegedly close to Zimbabwe’s new President. News24 recently reported that Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa had allegedly helped facilitate a chrome deal with Moti’s company, Africa Chrome Fields. Moti told News24 that his company had a number of planes which are hired out by Execujet and the National Airways Corporation (NAC) for commercial use. Moti said Execujet and the NAC, in turn, hire out the planes to the South African Air Force, which uses them to fly businessmen and Ministers, as well as the heads of state of a number of countries.

It later emerged in 2016 that a private jet was costing taxpayers at least R2 million to fly the President. Also in 2015, Ramaphosa, then the Deputy President of the country, flew to Japan on a chartered plane owned by the Gupta family. At the beginning of 2016, Zuma was said to have been stranded in Burundi because of problems with Inkwazi. It had also allegedly broken down in Qatar.

A public outcry followed and a new plane was never bought. The Mail & Guardian reported that the South African Air Force had a shortage of planes in their fleet, as well as a shortage of pilots for VVIP flights. The report said that the amenities needed on board such flights meant that the number of privately-owned planes in South Africa that the President could use was limited. In order to bring down the costs of hiring planes, a centralised contract was put in place to hire planes for the President, the paper reported. But after Ramaphosa’s flight to Japan in the Gupta jet, Defence and Military Veterans Minister Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula admitted that there may be security issues with this way of hiring planes, as the government did not necessarily know who owned the plane used by a head of state. Inkwazi undergoing checks Department of Defence spokesperson Siphiwe Dlamini told News24 that the reason the President was on a private plane was because Inkwazi was undergoing a “C check with SAA Technical”. This meant the plane would not be available for about six months “due to the nature of this procedure”. The department said it made use of chartered aircraft when: • the available serviceable aircraft is/are certified to be inadequate to safely ferry a specific number of passengers and or goods; • The serviceability status is assessed to have a potential to compromise the safety of both passengers and or crew. Dlamini said it was standard aircraft charter procedure for the Department of Defence to forward a request for an aircraft charter through the National Treasury under an approved contract process. He said the aircraft hired must be able to fulfil the leg of the trip without stopping, and must fulfil the number of the passengers, safety and all technical specification required. He said the aircraft was under the command and control of the military. He did not state how much it cost the government to hire the plane. – News24
