The DA announced on Thursday that it will be reporting EFF leader Julius Malema to the Equality Court for what it deems to be hate speech and incitement of violence On Tuesday, Malema threatened to remove the DA’s Nelson Mandela Bay Mayor Athol Trollip, should the party fail to show support for land expropriation without compensation. The DA quoted him as saying: “[W]e are going to remove a mayor of PE […] [w]e are going for your white man in PE. We are going to cut the throat.” The alleged comments amounted to hate speech and incitement of violence in terms of section 10 of the Promotion of Equality and Prevention of Unfair Discrimination Act, according to DA spokesperson Refiloe Nt’sekhe. “While these kinds of vile and bigoted statements have come to characterise the EFF and its leader, they have no place in South Africa and only undermines our constitutional democracy,” said Nt’sekhe.
