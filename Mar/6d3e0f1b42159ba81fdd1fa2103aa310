South African Reserve Bank (Sarb) Governor Lesetja Kganyago has announced that the troubled VBS Mutual Bank has been placed under curatorship This had resulted in VBS Mutual Bank being placed under intense regulatory scrutiny, EWN reports. This decision has the DA and EFF on opposing sides of the table. The DA welcomed the announcement: “This action was triggered by VBS’s inability to find sufficient funding following National Treasury instructing municipalities to stop investing with the bank and withdraw their funds,” DA spokesman Kevin Mileham said. The EFF was in complete disagreement, seeing the Sarb’s decision as premature.

Had it been a white-owned bank that had offered Zuma a loan, they would not be subject to victimisation today,” it said. “The liquidity challenges emanated from the maturity of a large concentration of deposits from municipalities and was exacerbated by the termination of other sizeable deposits and the inability to source sufficient funding timeously,” EWN quoted Kganyago as having said. – African News Agency
