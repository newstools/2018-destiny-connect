Former President Jacob Zuma will be summoned to appear in the High Court in Durban on 6 April, according to media reports on Sunday On 16 March, National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) head Shaun Abrahams announced that Zuma would go on trial on fraud, racketeering, corruption and money laundering charges. “After consideration of the matter, I am of the view that there are reasonable prospects to successfully prosecute Mr Zuma on charges listed in the indictment served on Mr Zuma prior to the determination of the matter by Mpshe, SC. As a result, Mr Zuma’s representations are unsuccessful,” Abrahams said at the time. All 16 counts in the 2007 indictment, before then Acting National Director of Public Prosecutions Mokotedi Mpshe’s decision to drop the charges against Zuma in 2009, will be reinstated. The counts include one of racketeering, two counts of corruption, one count of money laundering and 12 counts of fraud.
