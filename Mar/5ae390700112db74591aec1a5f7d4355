Former President Robert Mugabe doesn't want to join cash-starved Zimbabwe's bank queues: he wants to get his money out in cash – just like he's always done It’s emerged that the 94 year-old was getting $20 000 a month in cash while he was President – while telling ordinary citizens they should adopt plastic money. Now he’s asking for a lump sum pay-out of nearly half a million US dollars, plus his monthly pension of more than $13 000 in cash, reports the Sunday Mail. Public Service Commission Chairperson Mariyawanda Nzuwah wrote in a letter to Central Bank chief John Mangudya: “The former President was being paid his salary in cash and he has requested that the same arrangement be maintained.” “We are kindly requesting you to avail cash amounting to $467 200 and monthly cash amounts of $13 333 for us to pay the former President of Zimbabwe his pension benefits,” the letter said.
