Dolce & Gabbana merges fashion and design in their latest eyewear collection Introduce retro style to your sunglasses collection with oversized pair with Dolce & Gabbana’s new Customise Your Eyes collection, which features over-sized, round eyewear. This collection is special because it pays homage to the brand heritage and Mediterranean culture and includes floral and refined majolica, the traditional leo print on a burgundy background, detailing.   The shape instantly infuses any look with a playful, laid-back touch. This collection is all about personalisation and versatility, allowing one to modify frames by combining and using clip-ons.
