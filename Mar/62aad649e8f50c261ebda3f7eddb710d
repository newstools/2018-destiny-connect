Phakeng joined UCT in July 2016 and took over from Professor Danie Visser as the deputy vice-chancellor of research and internationalisation in January 2017.
She is a highly-regarded professor of mathematics education and has published more than 80 research papers. In a previous Powerhouse feature in DESTINY, Phakeng revealed that her compulsion to strive for excellence is primarily driven by a feeling that she’s not doing enough. “I’m not sure whether it has to do with the fact that I’m a woman or that I’m black, or because of my age. I feel as if I always have to work doubly hard,” she said. In 2002 she became SA’s first black woman to obtain a PhD in maths education and since then she’s carried out extensive research on the links between maths and language, published dozens of articles and spoken at many international conferences. In 2008, Phakeng became the first South African black researcher to be appointed to co-chair a study commissioned by the International Commission on Mathematical Instruction.

During a presentation last month, Phakeng addressed issues such as transformation at UCT and other higher education institutions and the legacy of UCT as a world-class university. Phakeng said students should become more involved in talks around transformation and decolonisation at universities. – With additional reporting by News24Wire
