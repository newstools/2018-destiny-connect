After a false start earlier this week, Cape Town Executive Mayor Patricia de Lille's disciplinary hearing is due to start on Thursday De Lille was charged with contravening the DA’s federal constitution amid claims of misconduct. Her disciplinary hearing got off to a slow start this week with technicalities including how the panel was appointed and how the hearing should be constituted. “We haven’t even gotten to the recusal of the panel yet,” she said earlier this week. De Lille believes that Sheila Camerer, one of the three panellists, was not “competent or suitable to hear the matter”. Previously, the Mayor said Camerer hadn’t “practised law in decades and she is a known political opponent”.

Selfe said internal party disciplinary issues were generally not open to the public. “Ms De Lille, having herself served on the federal executive of the DA for many years, and viewed the disciplinary process up close, had no issue with it until now,” he said. – News24
