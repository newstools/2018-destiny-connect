The producers of the film Inxeba will on Tuesday ask the North Gauteng High Court in Pretoria to order its porn rating overturned In a statement released by Mad Moth Communications, David Alex Wilson said the producers of the film, through their attorneys Webber Wentzel, served a lawsuit on 24 February seeking an urgent interdict to overturn the reclassification of the film. The Film and Publication Board Appeals Tribunal overturned the original classification of the 16LS and gave the film a rating of X18, classifying the film in the same category as hardcore pornography, Wilson said.
