The controversial Xhosa initiation film Inxeba (The Wound) was "unbanned" by the Pretoria High Court on Tuesday and will be back on mainstream cinema screens as of Friday, 9 March “I am hopeful that the capitulation of The Tribunal, Contralesa Gauteng and the Man and Boy Foundation to remove the X rating will assist in ensuring that the violent acts performed in opposition to the film are brought to an end, and that members of the public who wish to exercise their right to engage with Inxeba are no longer prohibited from doing so,” said producer Cait Pansegrouw.
