French beauty giant L'Oréal has acquired Canadian beauty tech company ModiFace L’Oréal hasn’t divulged how much the deal is worth, but the strategic acquisition falls in line with the cosmetics giant’s vision to strengthen its digital strategy and enhance its digital consumer experience. ModiFace is internationally recognised as an industry leader in artificial intelligence and augmented reality technology that is specifically applied to the beauty industry. It has developed technologies that gives users a virtual makeover experience by allowing users to experiment with eyeshadows, blushes and lipsticks in real time with a mirror reflection that shows you how the products would look on your face. The acquisition is a major coup for L’Oréal, as competitors like LVMH’s Sephora and Estee Lauder have used it to power their beauty apps.
