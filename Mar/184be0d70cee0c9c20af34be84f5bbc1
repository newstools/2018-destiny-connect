Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs Minister Zweli Mkhize has declared the prevailing water crisis affecting multiple provinces a national state of disaster Mkhize, on behalf of the inter-ministerial task team on water, told the media in Parliament on Tuesday that his decision was gazetted as at 10am this morning. Government previously reclassified the water crisis as a national disaster on 8 February. However, this was different to a declaration. Government can now access special funds through Treasury reserved for national disasters.

Mkhize called on all citizens to continue to save water and change behaviour, as South Africa is a water-scarce country. – News24
