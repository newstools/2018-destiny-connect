The South Gauteng High Court in Johannesburg on Monday ruled in favour of Export Development Canada (EDC) and ordered the grounding of the jet leased by Gupta family, whose whereabouts remain a mystery Earlier this month, the EDC requested that the court ground the Bombadier Global 6000 aircraft, leased by the Guptas, because they had defaulted on payments and could also possibly use the jet in the commission of a crime. At the time, Phil Taylor, a spokesman for the firm that provides Canadian exporters with trade financing, said EDC “is petitioning the courts to ground the aircraft”. Advocate Alfred Cockerell for EDC told the court the tracker on the jet had been switched off so it could not be traced. He asked the court to enforce its right to cancel the lease agreement and have the plane located and placed in a safe place.

The Guptas still owe the bank $27-million (R325 million). On Monday, the High Court ruled that the Guptas must hand over the Bombadier to EDC and have it stored at Lanseria Airport in Johannesburg. The Guptas have been interdicted from using the jet. The jet was last spotted in Moscow, Russia, last month. – African News Agency
