Afrosoul lead singer and actress Thandeka "MaZulu" Zulu is expecting her first child with band founder Sabelo "Muji" Ngema “We are expecting a baby boy or girl in the middle of the year, it is exciting news that we have been keeping it a secret for a while now, but can no longer keep it that way because it’s soon going to be very obvious,” says Zulu in a statement. The couple, who have not confirmed whether they will be having a boy or girl, started the lobola negotiations in 2016 and completed the process last year. “Our relationship has been somewhat of a mystery over the year or two, and we can officially say that we are soon to be engaged and will soon be getting married in the coming year,” says Ngema.
