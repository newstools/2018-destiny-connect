He allegedly later got into his car, still with the phone in his possession, and she ran after him. “I tried to open the driver’s door and found it locked. He still had my phone. He pulled away from the garage and I was still holding onto the door handle of the car and asking for my phone. I saw he had no intention of stopping,” she testified. She said her hand got caught in the door handle because of a chunky ring she was wearing. “As he accelerated, I grabbed on with both hands because my right arm would have been dislocated. I fell on the ground while he continued driving. I tried to stand up, but couldn’t,” she said.
