Only $250 million has been returned to Zimbabwe under an amnesty granted to those who siphoned money out of the country illegally for years, President Emmerson Mnangagwa said The money returned is thought to be a fraction of the total figure of $1,3 billion the authorities say was taken out during the rule of long-time leader Robert Mugabe, who was persuaded to step down last November. Offenders were given three months from 1 December to return money with no questions asked. So far, 105 have complied with the amnesty. But that’s only a fraction of the 1 166 cases the authorities know about, Mnangagwa said in a statement.

He said the names of those who didn’t comply with the extended amnesty would be published on 19 March. – News24
