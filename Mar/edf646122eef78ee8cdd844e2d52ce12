Former Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe reportedly flew to South Africa on Wednesday - for the first time since he was ousted from power in November - aboard an Air Zimbabwe flight A Zimbabwean journalist, @ray_Ndlovu, who apparently travelled on the same flight, tweeted: “Am on the same flight on Air Zimbabwe to Johannesburg with former President Robert Mugabe this morning. The times have changed. Really changed.” Reasons for the nonagenarian’s visit remain unclear. A report by SABC said: “Mugabe is known to have come to South Africa for a private visit earlier, but it is not clear if he is still in the country.” The report also claimed that workers at the veteran politician’s residence in Harare had been “taken in for questioning by soldiers on Wednesday morning”.
