South African President Cyril Ramaphosa has warned that land grabs would not be tolerated as the ruling ANC moves to change the Constitution to expropriate property without compensation Land remains an emotive issue in South Africa and most of it remains in white hands over two decades after apartheid’s demise, despite government programmes aimed at redistribution to narrow glaring racial disparities in ownership. Earlier this week, takeovers of vacant land in a suburb between Johannesburg and Pretoria provoked clashes with police. Speaking to the media in televised remarks near Pretoria after spending the day on a voter registration drive, Ramaphosa was asked about land invasions and the subsequent clashes with police. “We should not tolerate disorder and lawlessness of that type. Nobody has any right to invade land, to violate other people’s rights,” Ramaphosa said on Sunday.

Ramaphosa replaced Jacob Zuma last month as President after Zuma, whose administration was marred by scandal and missteps, was forced from office by the ANC. Earlier on Sunday, local media quoted Ramaphosa as telling a church service: “We are now in healing mode. God is addressing our problems, he is addressing our challenges.” –  Al Jazeera
