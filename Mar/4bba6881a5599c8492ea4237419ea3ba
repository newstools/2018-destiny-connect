Jordan Peele became the first black movie director to clinch an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay at the star-studded event on Sunday night Peele was awarded the golden gong for Get Out – a satirical thriller that interrogates racism. The movie is also Peele’s first crack at the directorship reins. “This means so much to me. I stopped writing this movie about 20 times because I thought it was impossible,” he said during his acceptance speech last night. “I thought it wasn’t gonna work. I thought no-one was gonna make this movie, but I kept coming back to it because I knew if someone let me make this movie, that people would hear it and people would see it. So I want to dedicate this to all the people who raised my voice and let me make this movie.” READ MORE: Only 13 black people have won Oscars – why? Peele also thanked his mother for teaching him how to love in the face of hate. Get Out was nominated in four Oscar categories and beat The Big Sick, Lady Bird, The Shape of Water and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri in the Best Original Screenplay category. The film was one of the top-performing flicks at the box office last year, with Huffington Post reporting that it garnered a whopping $176 million (R2,1 billion) locally. Peele is the fourth black film director to be nominated for the prestigious award in 90 years, after Spike Lee for Do The Right Thing, John Singleton for Boyz N the Hood and Suzanne de Passe for Lady Sings the Blues.
