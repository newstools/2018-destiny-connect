African Fashion International (AFI) put on a delight for the eyes at Cape Town Fashion Week It must be said that Dr Precious Moloi-Motsepe and her team curated a stylish and edgy production for the Autumn/Winter 2018 fashion week that was. This past weekend, the fashionably grungy Salt River Studios – a warehouse structure – was transformed into a whimsical, slightly rustic fashion wonderland. As you enter, guests were greeted by a totally unexpected backstage scene – models moving from one station to another, getting their hair and makeup done by Wella and MAC. As you moved further down the red carpet, you passed a pause area with enough bottles of Champagne to sustain a (model) army.
