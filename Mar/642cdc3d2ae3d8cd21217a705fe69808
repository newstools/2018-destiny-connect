Beauty queens and beauty brands have long enjoyed a history of partnership, as brands hope to capitalise on the popularity and leadership of the public’s choice of the greatest beauty in the land. However, for a brand to revisit a past ambassador when competitions like Miss and Mrs South Africa are constantly producing more beauty queens displays not only the brand’s allegiance to a particular figure, but also the past ambassador’s ability to continue to arouse the public’s interest. Kumalo has done just that. In a statement posted on her Instagram account, the 1994 Miss South Africa titleholder announced that she was “[d]elighted to be a Brand Ambassador for LUX. In 2008 I had the priviledge of being an ambassador and 10 years later, here we are again. This iconic brand has been around since 1925 and has stood the test of time. It epitomizes longevity, luxury, style, elegance and all things glamorous!” Basetsana Kumalo, who was runner-up at Miss World in 1994, has remained in the public eye as a TV host, philanthropist and businesswoman, as well as producing shows like Top Billing and Top Travel through her company Tswelopele Productions.
