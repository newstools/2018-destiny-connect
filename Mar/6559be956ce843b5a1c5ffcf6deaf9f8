We look at the latest street styles coming out of the French fashion capital Suited up There’s nothing better than a well fitted power suit, and the streets of Paris are serving us with just that this season. We absolutely love the tone of this look. Layered As much as the season calls for it, layering without looking like you walked out with half your wardrobe on your back can be challenging. We love this type of effortlessly chic layering. Perfect pairing  Pairing a blazer with a lace skirt gets thumbs-up from us – simple and sexy. The beret  We have been seeing this look on our streets. Colour coordinating your beret with your outfit will immediately help you stand out.
