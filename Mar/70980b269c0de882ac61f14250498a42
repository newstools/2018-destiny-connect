The NPA has reinstated 18 charges of corruption, money laundering and racketeering against former president Jacob Zuma The charges relate to 783 questionable payments Zuma allegedly received in connection with the controversial multi-billion rand arms deal.”I am of the view that there are reasonable prospects of a successful prosecution of Mr Zuma,” embattled NPA boss Shaun Abrahams said on Friday. He said he notified Zuma of his decision earlier in the day.

The tapes were made up of recordings of telephone conversations between then Scorpions boss Leonard McCarthy and former NPA boss Bulelani Ngcuka, which Zuma’s legal team claimed showed political interference in the decision to charge him. The charges were subsequently withdrawn, just before Zuma was sworn in for his first term as president. —News24 wire
