We give you our favourite beauty looks from this year's Academy Awards ceremony The Academy of Motion Pictures held its 90th Academy Awards ceremony last night and while not everyone could take home a golden statuette, some of the nominees could easily have walked away with best beauty honours on the red carpet. We present our beauty Oscars! Danai Gurira Gurira proved you don’t need hair or accessories to work a gorgeous look with this intricate head stamp, which was masterfully cut to highlight the style. Lupita Nyong’o Nyong’o completed the Wakanda red carpet beauty takeover by twining gold through her beautifully sculpted  afro and contrasting her golden look with a deep blue eye for a pharaonic look. She said she was inspired by the Amasunzu hairstyles worn in Rwanda. Andra Day Songstress Day brought a hint of whimsy to the red carpet by adding light florals to her hair and pairing the look with a burgundy eye. Betty Gabriel Get Out actress Gabriel brought ethereal, breezy waves to the carpet. Maya Rudolph Actress and comedian Rudolph went for an understated look with heavily defined natural brows and a red-orange lip to match her red Valentino gown. This look, reminiscent of artist Frida Kahlo, was simple yet elegant.
