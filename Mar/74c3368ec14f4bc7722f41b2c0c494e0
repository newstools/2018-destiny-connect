DA leader Mmusi Maimane and the party’s shadow minister on rural development and land reform Thandeka Mbabama will set out the DA’s position on land reform on Monday The leader of the opposition is expected to speak about the party’s land reform policy at the Old Fort at Constitution Hill in Johannesburg on Monday. This comes after the party faced criticism on Sunday for an SMS it had been sending out to the public to encourage people to register to vote this past weekend. The SMS reads: “ANC & EFF working together to take all private land and homes. You can only stop this if you’re registered correctly to vote! Check now.” The DA will speak about its land policy, after major developments in recent weeks over land expropriation without compensation.
